SET Evidence = "We previously showed that beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved not only in the middle of the membrane (gamma-cleavage) but also at novel cleavage sites close to the membrane/cytoplasmic boundary (ε-cleavage), releasing APP intracellular domains (AICDs) 49−99 and 50−99. To learn more about the relationship between gamma- and ε-cleavage, C-terminally truncated carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, especially CTFs1−48 and 1−49 (the postulated products that are generated by ε-cleavage), were transiently expressed in CHO cells. Most importantly, the cells expressing CTF1−49 secreted predominantly amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) 40, while those expressing CTF1−48 secreted preferentially Abeta42. This supports our assumption that ε-cleavage precedes Αbeta production and that preceding ε-cleavage determines the preference for the final Abeta species. The gamma-secretase inhibitors, L-685,458 and DAPT, suppressed Abeta production from CTF1−49. Regarding Abeta production from CTF1−48, L-685,458 suppressed it, but DAPT failed to do so. A dominant negative mutant of presenilin 1 suppressed the production of Abeta40 and 42 from both CTFs1−48 and 1−49. These data should shed significant light into the mechanism of Abeta production."

SET Evidence = "Calsyntenin-1 is a ligand for kinesin-1 light chains and APP is transported through axons on kinesin-1 molecular motors. Defects in axonal transport are an early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease and defective APP transport is known to increase Abeta production. We show that calsyntenin-1 and APP are co-transported through axons and that siRNA-induced loss of calsyntenin-1 markedly disrupts axonal transport of APP. Thus, perturbation to axonal transport of APP on calsyntenin-1 containing carriers induces alterations to APP processing that increase production of Abeta. Together, our findings suggest that disruption of calsyntenin-1-associated axonal transport of APP is a pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease."

SET Evidence = "In this issue of Nature Medicine, Thathiah et al.4 now provide provocative evidence that the adaptor protein beta mediates the Abeta-altering effects of these GPCRs by promoting Abeta generation. This newly uncovered function of beta-arrestin 2 suggests it could be targeted to decrease amyloid pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Production of the amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease by the gamma-secretase complex can be regulated by certain G protein coupled receptors. This regulation seems to be mediated by beta-arrestin-2, whose expression was found to be elevated in Alzheimer's disease brains.Recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 to a GPCR leads to interaction with the gamma-secretase complex via the Aph-1 subunit. Other members of the complex include presenilin-1 (PS-1), nicastrin (Nct) and Pen-2. The complex then moves laterally into lipid rafts, where gamma-secretase activation is enhanced. Internalization may also occur to localize gamma-secretase to late endosomes, where its activation is also increased. Cleavage of APP by beta-secretase (BACE1) to release soluble APP (sAPPb) followed by gamma-secretase produces Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD). Increased production and secretion of Abeta from cells can lead to extracellular Abeta aggregation in the form of plaques. Mutagenesis of GPR3 in regions of the protein that specifically interact with either G protein or beta-arrestin 2 further showed that beta-arrestin 2, not G protein, mediates the ability of GPR3 to increase Abeta levels."

The correlation of these markers with clinical parameters was also evaluated. The levels of p-tau were higher in AD compared to controls, while the tau/p-tau ratio was decreased. The expression of CCL2 was increased in AD. A positive correlation was observed between BA levels and all chemokines studied, and between CCL2 and p-tau levels.

Here we show that both AMPK and calcineurin modulate longevity exclusively through post-translational modification of CRTC-1, the sole C. elegans CRTC. We demonstrate that CRTC-1 is a direct AMPK target, and interacts with the CREB homologue-1 (CRH-1) transcription factor in vivo. The pro-longevity effects of activating AMPK or deactivating calcineurin decrease CRTC-1 and CRH-1 activity and induce transcriptional responses similar to those of CRH-1 null worms. Downregulation of crtc-1 increases lifespan in a crh-1-dependent manner and directly reducing crh-1 expression increases longevity, substantiating a role for CRTCs and CREB in ageing. Together, these findings indicate a novel role for CRTCs and CREB in determining lifespan downstream of AMPK and calcineurin, and illustrate the molecular mechanisms by which an evolutionarily conserved pathway responds to low energy to increase longevity."

SET Evidence = "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) usually lead to increases in amyloid Abeta-protein (Abeta) levels or aggregation. Here, we identified a novel APP mutation, located within the Abeta sequence (Abeta(D7H)), in a Taiwanese family with early onset AD and explored the pathogenicity of this mutation. Cellular and biochemical analysis reveal that this mutation increased Abeta production, Abeta42/40 ratio and prolonged Abeta42 oligomer state with higher neurotoxicity. Because the D7H mutant Abeta has an additional metal ion-coordinating residue, histidine, we speculate that this mutation may promote susceptibility of Abeta to ion. When co-incubated with Zn(2+) or Cu(2+), Abeta(D7H) aggregated into low molecular weight oligomers. Together, the D7H mutation could contribute to AD pathology through a double punch effect on elevating both Abeta production and oligomerization. Although the pathogenic nature of this mutation needs further confirmation, our findings suggest that the Abeta N-terminal region potentially modulates APP processing and Abeta aggregation, and further provides a genetic indication of the importance of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) in the etiology of AD.Our result indicates that the D7H mutation promotes Abeta40 interaction with Zn2+ and Cu2+, where the Abeta interaction with Zn2+ is especially enhanced by the mutation"

SET Evidence = "In particular,in receptor TK, tyrosine residue can be phosphorylated to generate the NPXpY motif, which represents a docking sitefor several intracellular adaptor proteins through the phosphortyrosine-binding domain (PTB). Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration."

The increased phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2, often described in AD brain, is also observed in thrombin-activated astrocytes, suggesting that, in this model, ERK1/2 may be activated by AbetaPP through ShcA. These data give prominence to the biological importance of AbetaPP phosphorylation for its functions and the regulation of intracellular adaptor binding as events responsible for the induction of glial-associated mitogenic pathway. Furthermore, ERK1/2, activated by Abetain vitro, plays a role in AbetaPP processing and phosphorylates Tau in a PHF-Tau similar manner.

Subsequently, a novel interaction between reelin and AbetaPP was discovered, leading to increase in the cell surface levels of AbetaPP and affecting AbetaPP processing and Abeta production. It was shown that reelin signaling in excitatory synapses can restore normal synaptic plasticity, which is impaired by oligomeric Abeta peptides at concentrations within the range detectable in the brains of AD patients. At high concentrations of Abeta peptides, reelin can no longer overcome the Abeta-induced functional suppression, and this condition coincides with a complete blockade of the reelin-dependent phosphorylation of NR2 subunits in NMDA receptors. This reversal requires the LRP receptor-dependent activation of tyrosine kinases of the Src family."

We cloned the novel ubiquitin ligase HRD1, which is involved in ERAD, and showed that HRD1 promoted amyloid precursor protein (APP) ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in decreased generation of amyloid Abeta (Abeta). In addition, suppression of HRD1 expression caused APP accumulation and promoted Abeta generation associated with ER stress and apoptotic process. Interestingly, HRD1 levels were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the brains of these patients experienced ER stress. Our recent study revealed that this decrease in HRD1 was due to its insolubilization; however, controversy persists about whether the decrease in HRD1 protein promotes Abeta generation or whether Abeta neurotoxicity causes the decrease in HRD1 protein levels. Here, we review current findings on the mechanism of HRD1 protein loss in the AD brain and the involvement of HRD1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Furthermore, we propose that HRD1 may be a target for novel AD therapeutics."

SET Evidence = "gene mutation of presenilin, which is a component of the gamma-secretase complex and is associated with familial AD, results in an attenuation of ER chaperone expression during ER stress. Mutations in presenilin inhibit activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, all of which act as signal transducers of ER stress in the ER membrane (for details, see the article by Hosoi and Ozawa in this Forum Minireview series: Ref. 14), thereby making neurons vulnerable to ER stress. In addition, nitric oxideâ€“induced S-nitrosylation of ER chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) inhibits its enzymatic activity, leading to ER stressâ€“induced neuronal death. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of PDI has been observed in the brain of sporadic AD and PD patients. ER stress can also cause AD onset. For example, eIF2a phosphorylation, which is induced by eIF2a kinase PERK, elevates BACE1 (Abeta-secretase) levels and causes increased Abeta production (17). Furthermore, Abeta has been reported to induce ER stress, leading to activation of ER stressâ€“specific initiator caspases, including mouse caspase- 12 and human caspase-4. In conclusion, because postmortem AD patient brain samples exhibit activated UPR markers, including phosphorylated PERK, eIF2a, and IRE1, ER stress probably plays a key role in AD pathogenesis as a cause or consequence"

The crystal structure of a C-terminally extended Mint1 PTB fragment reveals that the linker region forms a short a-helix that folds back onto the PTB domain and sterically hinders APP binding. This intramolecular interaction is disrupted by mutation of Tyr633 within the Mint1 autoinhibitory helix leading to enhanced APP binding and Abeta-amyloid production.

SET Evidence = "Although there are numerous studies regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD), the cause and progression of AD are still not well understood. The researches in the past decade implicated amyloid-beta (Abeta) overproduction as a causative event in disease pathogenesis, but still failed to clarify the mechanism of pathology from Abeta production to central neural system defects in AD. The present review raises the hypothesis that the onset of AD pathology is closely related with mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) axonal transport deficits. It is well-known that axonal transport defect and attenuation of BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 (TrkB) signal are fatal to neuronal function and survival.We hypothesized that abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta production in mitochondria disturb the axonal transport by impairing mitochondrial function and attenuate BDNF-neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 signal subsequently.For this hypothesis, the factors related with the initiation of AD pathology are not only limited to the neurons per se but also expanded to the microenvironment around neurons, such as the secretion of BDNF from astrocytes. The modification of the origin in this pathway may contribute to slow down the disease progression of AD."

Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3beta to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3beta activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3beta, or at Thr-668, the GSK3beta phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3beta activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3beta kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease."

SET Evidence = "Background and Objective: Could a normal - but persistent - stress response to impeded axonal transport lead to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER. This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD."

SET Evidence = "Abeta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer (AD) brains are surrounded by severe dendritic and axonal changes, including local spine loss, axonal swellings and distorted neurite trajectories. Whether and how plaques induce these neuropil abnormalities remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that oligomeric assemblies of Abeta, seen in the periphery of plaques, mediate the neurodegenerative phenotype of AD by triggering activation of the enzyme GSK-3beta, which in turn appears to inhibit a transcriptional program mediated by CREB. We detect increased activity of GSK-3beta after exposure to oligomeric Abeta in neurons in culture, in the brain of double transgenic APP/tau mice and in AD brains. Activation of GSK-3beta, even in the absence of Abeta, is sufficient to produce a phenocopy of Abeta-induced dendritic spine loss in neurons in culture, while pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3beta prevents spine loss and increases expression of CREB-target genes like BDNF. Of note, in transgenic mice GSK-3beta inhibition ameliorated plaque-related neuritic changes and increased CREB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, GSK-3beta inhibition robustly decreased the oligomeric Abeta load in the mouse brain. All these findings support the idea that GSK3beta is aberrantly activated by the presence of Abeta, and contributes, at least in part, to the neuronal anatomical derangement associated with Abeta plaques in AD brains and to Abeta pathology itself."

SET Evidence = "The interaction of APP with APP-BP1 activates a pathway leading to the conjugation of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to its target (Fig. 1, ref. 44). APP-BP1, together with hUba3, is functionally analogous to the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, with hUba3 containing the active cysteine and ATP binding site. When NEDD8 is activated by the APP-BP1/hUba3 complex, it forms a thiol ester bond with hUbc12, which has a function parallel to that of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc32. Subsequently, NEDD8 is covalently coupled to lysine residues in its target proteins (46). So far, the proteins known to be neddylated via this pathway are a family of proteins called cullins (47) and the Mdm2 oncogene product, which in turn regulates neddylation of the cell cycle protein p53. Cullins are scaffold proteins for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and neddylation of cullin enhances its ability to promote ubiquitination (49,50). Indeed, NEDD8 has been found in ubiquitinated neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain (51). NEDD8 signalling has been shown to regulate protein degradation pathways participating in cell cycle progression (52â€“55). The discovery of a novel protein, NUB1, which recruits NEDD8-conjugates to the proteasome for degradation, provides a direct link between these 2 systems (56,57). Inhibition of the neddylation pathway in neurons by expression of a dominant negative mutant of hUbc12 prevents FAD APP-mediated cell cycle entry and apoptotic process (44,45). Thus, elements of this pathway are attractive targets for potential therapies aimed at preventing neurons in AD brain from entering the cell cycle."

These accumulate to form toxic oligomers and the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An increase of BACE1 levels in the brain of AD patients has been mostly attributed to alterations of its intracellular trafficking. Golgi-associated adaptor proteins, GGA sort BACE1 for export to the endosomal compartment, which is the major cellular site of BACE1 activity. BACE1 undergoes recycling between endosome, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the plasma membrane, from where it is endocytosed and either further recycled or retrieved to the endosome. Phosphorylation of Ser498 facilitates BACE1 recognition by GGA1 for retrieval to the endosome. Ubiquitination of BACE1 C-terminal Lys501 signals GGA3 for exporting BACE1 to the lysosome for degradation. In addition, the retromer mediates the retrograde transport of BACE1 from endosome to TGN. Decreased levels of GGA proteins and increased levels of retromer-associated sortilin have been associated with AD. Both would promote the co-localization of BACE1 and the amyloid precursor protein in the TGN and endosomes. Decreased levels of GGA3 also impair BACE1 degradation. Further understanding of BACE1 trafficking and its regulation may offer new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

Emerging evidence demonstrates that AMPK activation is a potential target for improving perturbed brain energy metabolism that is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The roles of AMPK in the pathogenesis of AD include Abeta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation and tau phosphorylation. In particular, AMPK may regulate Abeta generation through modulating neuronal cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels and through regulating APP distribution in the lipid rafts. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-172 by LKB1 complex in response to increase in the AMP/ATP ratio and by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta in response to elevated Ca(2+) levels, which contributes to regulating Abeta generation. AMPK is a physiological tau kinase and can increase the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. AMPK can also directly phosphorylate tau at Thr-231 and Ser-396/404. Furthermore, AMPK activation decreases mTOR signaling activity to facilitate autophagy and promotes lysosomal degradation of Abeta. However, AMPK activation has non-neuroprotective property and may lead to detrimental outcomes, including Abeta generation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, it is still unclear whether AMPK could serve a potential therapeutic target for AD, and hence, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of AMPK in AD."

The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD."

SET Evidence = "It is believed that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the process of amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage is a key event and has raised much attention in the field of AD research. It is proposed that APP, beta- and gamma-secretases are all located on the lipid raft, and the meeting of them is an indispensable step for Abeta generation. Endocytosis can lead to clustering of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases from separate smaller lipid rafts into a larger one. On the other hand, for myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or interaction with Ca(2+) can lead to its release from membrane into cytoplasm. This process induces the release of actins and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which are important factors for endocytosis. Thus, the present review proposes that MARCKS may be implicated in Abeta generation, by modulating free PIP2 level and actin movement, causing endocytosis"

SET Evidence = "Abeta is a fragment of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) generated in neurons by two proteases, beta- and gamma-secretases. APP and beta-secretase, both present on cell surface, are endocytosed into endosomes to produce Abeta. The molecular mechanism by which neurons trigger the production of Abeta is poorly understood. We describe here evidence that the binding of lipid-carrying apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to receptor apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) triggers the endocytosis of APP, beta-secretase, and ApoER2 in neuroblastoma cells, leading to the production of Abeta. This mechanism, mediated by adaptor protein X11alpha or X11beta (X11alpha/beta), whose PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain binds to APP and a newly recognized motif in the cytosolic domain of ApoER2. Isomorphic form ApoE4 triggers the production of more Abeta than by ApoE2 or ApoE3; thus, it may play a role in the genetic risk of ApoE4 for the sporadic AD."

Based on this, one can speculate that mutations on TOM40 gene may result in the dysfunction of general import pore TOM40 protein, which may in turn accentuate the mitochondrial translocational arrest of APP and associated mitochondrial dysfunction.

Inflammation has previously been linked to increased abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein.To determine if endogenous amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammation drives tau phosphorylation in vivo, we treated 8-month-old 3xTg-AD with minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent, to assess how it influenced cognitive decline and development of pathology. 4 months of treatment restored cognition to non-transgenic performance. Inflammatory profiling revealed a marked decrease in GFAP, TNFalpha, and IL6 and an increase in the CXCL1 chemokines KC and MIP1a. Minocycline also reduced levels of insoluble Abeta and soluble fibrils. Despite reducing levels of the tau kinase cdk5 coactivator p25, minocycline did not have wide effects on tau pathology with only one phospho-epitope showing reduction with treatment (S212/S214). The sum of these findings shows that reduction of the inflammatory events in an AD mouse model prevents cognitive deficits associated with pathology, but that endogenous Abeta-derived neuroinflammation does not contribute significantly to the development of tau pathology."

SET Evidence = "Reverse signaling through the ephrinB ligands is important for several morphogenetic events, such as axon guidance, neuronal plasticity, spine maturation, and synaptogenesis. Signaling is initiated by binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation via an unclear mechanism. Here we show that this mechanism involves presenilin1 (PS1)/gamma-secretase regulation of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk binding protein (PAG/Cbp), an adaptor protein that controls the activity of Src kinases.Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot of mouse primary neuronal and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell extracts overexpressing PAG/Cbp, we show that EphB2 induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp in a gamma-secretase-dependent manner. In these cells, PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation is promoted by the PS1/gamma-secretase-produced fragment of ephrinB2 cleavage (ephrinB2/CTF2), which forms complexes with PAG/Cbp when introduced exogenously. EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB2 depends on PAG/Cbp because EphB2 cannot increase ephrinB2 phosphorylation in cells treated with anti-PAG siRNA or in PAG/Cbp-knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, in contrast to WT PS1, familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) PS1 mutants expressed in PS1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibited both the EphB2-induced dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and the phosphorylation of ephrinB2. PS1 FAD mutations may thus inhibit the function of ephrinB in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease."

Nevertheless, the amplitude of baseline transmission remains remarkably constant even though low frequency stimulation is also associated with an NMDAR-dependent influx of Ca(2+) into dendritic spines. We show here that an interaction between C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and NMDARs controls the Src-dependent regulation of NMDAR activity. Csk associates with the NMDAR signaling complex in the adult brain, inhibiting the Src-dependent potentiation of NMDARs in CA1 neurons and attenuating the Src-dependent induction of long-term potentiation. Csk associates directly with Src-phosphorylated NR2 subunits in vitro. An inhibitory antibody for Csk disrupts this physical association, potentiates NMDAR mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents, and induces long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses. Thus, Csk serves to maintain the constancy of baseline excitatory synaptic transmission by inhibiting Src kinase-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus"

SET Evidence = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with progressive dementia accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons; intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Recent studies have suggested that the trafficking process of membrane associated proteins is modulated by the FAD-linked presenilin (PS) proteins, and that amyloid beta-peptide deposition may be initiated intracellularly, through the secretory pathway. Current hypotheses concerning presenilin function are based upon its cellular localization and its putative interaction as macromolecular complexes with the cell-adhesion/signaling beta-catenin molecule and the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) enzyme. Developmental studies have shown that PS proteins function as components in the Notch signal transduction cascade and that beta-catenin and GSK-3beta are transducers of the Wnt signaling pathway. Both pathways are thought to have an important role in brain development, and they have been connected through Dishevelled (Dvl) protein, a known transducer of the Wnt signaling pathway.

SET Evidence = "Phosphorylation of the neurofilament proteins of high and medium relative molecular mass, as well as of the Alzheimer's tau protein, is thought to be catalysed by a protein kinase with Cdc2-like substrate specificity. We have purified a novel Cdc2-like kinase from bovine brain capable of phosphorylating both the neurofilament proteins and tau. The purified enzyme is a heterodimer of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and a novel regulatory subunit, p25. When overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli, p25 can activate Cdk5 in vitro. Unlike Cdk5, which is ubiquitously expressed in human tissue, the p25 transcript is expressed only in brain. A full-length complementary DNA clone showed that p25 is a truncated form of a larger protein precursor, p35, which seems to be the predominant form of the protein in crude brain extract. Cdk5/p35 is the first example of a Cdc2-like kinase with neuronal function."

These effects can be restored by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of cdk5. Moreover, cdk5-deficient cultured cortical neurons exhibit increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, as well as elevated JNK3 activity and c-Jun phosphorylation.

SET Evidence = "Mitochondrial cyclophilin D: Once inside the mitochondria, Abeta is able to interact with a number of targets, including the mitochondrial proteins ABAD and cyclophilin-D (CypD). Opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to depolarize mitochondria and release cytochrome C may be central to mitochondrial and neuronal malfunction in AD patients. CypD, an integral part of the MPTP, whose opening leads to cell death, interacts with Abeta peptide within the mitochondria of AD patients and a Tg mouse model of AD. MPTP causes mitochondrial swelling, outer membrane rupture, release of cell death mediators and enhances production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Computer simulation studies show that Abeta interacts with both ANT and CypD. CypD/Abeta interaction causes an oxidative stress and increased MPTP opening that triggers neurodegeneration. CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling and MPTP opening. Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a transport protein for ADP and ATP and component of MPTP that binds directly to CypD. This interaction may facilitate its anchoring in the inner membrane and disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial swelling and cell death. Interestingly, the MPTP also requires the participation of members of the Bcl-2 family proteins but a clear understanding of the interaction of Abeta with CypD together with both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in AD has not been made. The ability of CypD to protect neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death and its role in improvement of synaptic and cognitive functions has been suggested to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of conditions associated with AD. Together these studies provide new mechanisms for Abeta targets that link the MPTP to synaptic stress and the neurodegeneration seen in AD."

Our previous work shows that hippocampal NAD(P)H and glutathione (GSH) decline with age in association with increased susceptibility to glutamate toxicity in neurons of old-age. Thus, an age-related decline in neuronal reducing currency (NAD[P]H) and reducing buffer (GSH) will surely promote oxidative stress and excess ROS.

These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP). There is no direct evidence indicating how lower levels of Abeta might initiate CREB phosphorylation principally by Ca2+ signaling and/or through PKA/Atk/ERK pathways. However, exceeding physiological levels of Abeta could deregulate Ca2+ signaling mechanism by excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria. Since hippocampal neuronal calcium is one of the most potent signals in neuronal gene expression [149], Abeta-induced Ca2+ deregulation may lead to compromised synaptic function. Consistence with this hypothesis, AD has been associated with impaired cAMP signaling which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Levels of the activated (i.e. phosphorylated) form of CREB are reduced in AD compared to that of an age-matched healthy control group [164]. Calcium signaling to the cell nucleus is the key inducer of CREB phosphorylation on its activator site serine 133 [165]. Experiments in aged neurons show altered calcium signaling at the level of either calcium signal generation and/or calcium signal propagation [166]. These studies indicate a critical role of calcium in Abeta-induced synaptic activity and memory formation by regulating specific signal transduction pathways."

Here, we show that the R-SNAREs VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2, which cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes, bind directly to the ubiquitously expressed, PtdIns4,5P(2)-binding, endocytic clathrin adaptor CALM/PICALM. X-ray crystallography shows that the N-terminal halves of their SNARE motifs bind the CALM(ANTH) domain as helices in a manner that mimics SNARE complex formation. Mutation of residues in the CALM:SNARE interface inhibits binding in vitro and prevents R-SNARE endocytosis in vivo. Thus, CALM:R-SNARE interactions ensure that R-SNAREs, required for the fusion of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles with endosomes and also for subsequent postendosomal trafficking, are sorted into endocytic vesicles. CALM's role in directing the endocytosis of small R-SNAREs may provide insight into the association of CALM/PICALM mutations with growth retardation, cognitive defects, and Alzheimer's disease"

LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D). The Bid activation then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation [19]. However, massive LMP often results in cell death without caspase activation, which may adopt a subapoptotic or necrotic appearance.

Cathepsins D and E (intracellular aspartyl proteases) are considered to influence Abeta peptides generation within the endosomalâ€“lysosomal pathway because they exhibit beta- and gamma-secretase like-activity [32]. For this reason, the endosomalâ€“lysosomal pathway is a site for cleavage of the APP into smaller beta-amyloid-containing peptides, which are then degraded by cathepsins. Inhibition of cathepsins activity causes a rapid and pronounced build-up of potentially amyloidogenic protein fragments [33]. On the other hand, a failure to degrade aggregated Abeta_42 in late endosomes or secondary lysosomes was a mechanism that contributed to intracellular accumulation of Abeta in AD. The cysteine protease cathepsin B in lysosomes degrades A peptides, especially the aggregation-prone species Abeta_42."

SET Evidence = "Assemblies of Abeta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Abeta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. The generation of Abeta is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Abeta. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate gamma-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence."

In the human brain, endosomal processing of APP produces neurotoxic Abeta-peptides, which are involved in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that the Abeta sequence exerts a physiological function when still present in the unprocessed APP molecule. From the extracellular site, Abeta concentrates APP molecules into plasmalemmal membrane protein clusters. Moreover, Abeta stabilization of clusters is a prerequisite for their targeting to endocytic clathrin structures. Therefore, we conclude that the Abeta domain directly mediates a central step in APP trafficking, driving its own conversion into neurotoxic peptides."

SET Evidence = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. The extracellular Abeta oligomers may activate caspases through activation of cell surface death receptors. Alternatively, intracellular Abeta may contribute to pathology by facilitating tau hyper-phosphorylation, disrupting mitochondria function, and triggering calcium dysfunction. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress."

SET Evidence = "Amyloid is a term used to describe typically extracellular deposits of aggregated proteins, sometimes known as plaques. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid is Amyloidosis, a term associated with diseased organs and tissues, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-Beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008). An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation."

Both SNPs within SOS2 were significantly associated with disease status, with the remaining positive SNPs located within RPS6KA2 (Gene ID 6196), HNF4A (Gene ID 3172), PPP1CC (Gene ID 5501), and PCK1. Additional analysis of the data stratified by APOE genotype provided evidence of association for 15 SNPs in either the APOE ε4 positive or APOE ε4 negative sample sets (Table I). Two of these SNPs were associated in the overall Stage 1 sample; SNP 139 (HNF4A) and SNP 150 (PCK1), and it was observed that these SNPs had a greater effect when stratified by APOE genotype: OR 0.5 versus 0.63; OR 2.11 versus 1.54, respectively. Two further PCK1 SNPs (SNP 144 and SNP 149) showed marginal association in the APOE ε4 positive samples (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.07, 0.09). In addition, there was evidence of positive association for both PPARgamma polymorphisms (SNP 65 and SNP 66) in the APOE ε4 positive sample set. Allele 2 of both of these SNPs (G and T, respectively) appeared to protect against disease (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.5, ORâ€‰=â€‰0.45). The result obtained with the major allele of SNP 52 within INSR (Gene ID 3643), allele A, was also suggestive of a protective factor (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.5; APOE ε4 negative samples). A further SNP from INSR, SNP 48, showed a trend toward association, but this result was observed in the APOE ε4 positive samples (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.06). SNP 20 from the ENPP1 gene (Gene ID 5167) showed evidence for association in both the APOE ε4 positive and ε4 negative samples. A final 7 SNPs showed evidence of association in the APOE ε4 positive samples, SNP 34 (INPPL1 Gene ID 3636), SNP 62 (HK2 Gene ID 3099), SNP 93 (NOS3 Gene ID 4846), and in the APOE ε4 negative samples, SNP 72 (GC Gene ID 2638), SNP 94 (ADRB3 Gene ID 155), SNP 130 (CETP Gene ID 1071), and SNP 136 (PPP2R1A Gene ID 5518).

SET Evidence = "Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARgamma leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in beta-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3beta is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARgamma by a potent ligand leads to beta-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARgamma activation in neuroprotection, PPARgamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARgamma activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARgamma in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARgamma protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005]."

Through further subfractionation, using sucrose gradients, we showed that metformin treatment caused changes in the compartmentalization of APP, as evidenced by increased distribution in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles (fraction 2), including those trafficks en route to early endosomes and TGN (fraction 3), and decreased distribution in membranes (fraction 5) (Fig. S1 B and C). BACE1 protein levels were found to be elevated in all 3 fractions: 2, 3, and 5, with an â‰ˆ2-fold increase of the total protein. The increased distribution of both APP and BACE1 in fractions 2 and 3 are expected to favor Abeta generation within TGN and/or endocytic compartments, the two compartments with mild acidic pH optimal for BACE1 activity (33, 34). Indeed, we detected increased immunofluorescent Abeta40 signals after metformin treatment in TGN (Fig. 1E)."

We also observed a significant inhibition of metformin-stimulated Abeta production by compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner. Compound C inhibited metformin's effect by 50% when used at a concentration (20 Î¼M) that is known to guarantee its specificity for AMPK (32) (Fig. 4C). These results indicate an AMPK-dependent mechanism for metformin's effect on Abeta.

SET Evidence = "Alzheimer's disease is an age-related form of dementia due to a progressive loss of neuronal functioning, also characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid throughout the brain (amyloid plaques) and a significant decrease in brain mass. An overactivity of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase CDK5 in the brain has been implicated in neuronal degeneration and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles due to hyperphosphorylation of essential neuronal proteins such as MAP and Tau (2). CDK5 is regulated by the neuron-specific and cyclin-related protein p35 (also known as p35Ncdk5a). During the development of Alzheimer's disease, p35 is processed to a smaller protein, p25, which is a constitutive activator of CDK5. The generation of p25 disrupts CDK5 localization and substrate preferences (2). In addition, the expression of p25 in neurons results in a collapse of microtubules, neurite retraction, and apoptosis (2)."

Biochemical characterization of CDK5 kinase activity was also investigated. Among the different cell lines tested, only INS-1 cells, an insulin-producing beta-cell line, showed expression of p35 (Fig. 2A). These cells also contain protein kinase activity that can be immunoprecipitated with a p35-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). Both p35 expression and p35/CDK5 activity were absent in other cell lines, such as HeLa and NIH-3T3 (Fig. 2, A and B), although these cell lines expressed CDK5 protein (Fig. 2A). We then investigated whether the kinase activity immunoprecipitated by the p35 antibody was due to its association with CDK5. We performed experiments with roscovitine, a relatively specific inhibitor of CDK5 activity (17). The p35/CDK5 activity in INS-1 cells was inhibited by roscovitine, but not by other protein kinase inhibitors, such as H89 (protein kinase A) and SB202190 (p38MAPK; Fig. 2C). Also, the inhibition by roscovitine was dose dependent (Fig. 2D), with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 128 nm, within the range of that previously reported for CDK5 (18)."

Recently, Pho-85, a yeast ortholog of CDK5, was shown to be involved in metabolic control by regulating different steps of glycogen and phosphate metabolism (13).

SET Evidence = "In neurons, p35/CDK5 regulates not only cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration, but also the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the calcium-mediated signaling pathway (14). It also regulates dopamine signaling through phosphorylation of DARPP-32, which converts it into an inhibitor of protein kinase A (25). Therefore, we anticipate that in beta-cells the presence of p35/CDK5 could be involved in the regulation of additional functional pathways. Our findings also indicate that in insulin-producing beta-cells, CDK5 activity is predominantly regulated by variations in the expression of its activator p35, which, in turn, is regulated by extracellular glucose concentrations. During brain development, the expression of p35 seems to be constitutive, and regulation of CDK5 activity is dependent on its subcellular localization, phosphorylation by other protein kinases such as Abl, and association with other regulatory proteins (Dab1 and Cables) (14). However, up-regulation of p35 at the level of transcription can also occur, as shown after stimulation by laminin in cultured neurons (26), nerve growth factor in PC12 cells (27), neuroregulin in cultured myotubules (23), and chronic cocaine administration to rats (28)."

Binding of insulin and IGF-1 to their receptors leads to autophosphorylation of the -subunit of the IR/IGF-IR and recruitment of IRS-1 /-2. IRS proteins activate mainly two pathways, the PI3 kinase pathway, and the RAS-RAF-MAP kinase cascade. Tau phosphorylation via IR/IGF-1 signaling is influenced by GSK-3 and the tau phosphatase PP2A. InterÂ­ estingly, mTOR signaling couples the activity ofPP2A and GSK-3in a way that the activities of both enzymes change always in the same direction. suggesting that only a dysregulation of either PP2A or GSK-3induces tau hyperphosphorylation. The PI3K pathway as well as the RAS-RAF-MAPK cascade regulate different transcription factors involved in transcriptional regulation of metabolism and clearance of Â­ amyloid. APP is cleaved by a.-, -secretase (BACE-1) and y-secretase (presenilin). - and subsequent y-cleavage of APP leads to generation of -amyloid 1 -4o/ t-42â€¢ IGF-1 signaling promotes a switch lrom TrkA to p75NTR expression leading to increased -secretase activity due to an upregulation of BACE-1 expression. Recent data suggest that not only BACE-1 is int1uenced by IRIIGF- IR mediated signals but also a.Â­ secretase activity is stimulated by the PI3K pathway."

This implies a protective role of PP2A in neurodegeneration which is consistent with the finding that PP2A activity is reduced in AD brains [104, 105]."

SET Evidence = "Experiments in Caenoi-habditis elegans revealed new insights into the role oflR/IGF-IR signaling in A1 -42 toxicÂ­ ity, and Ametabolism. Cohen and coworkers could show that knocking down the DAF-2 pathway in C. elegans, which is orthologous to the mammalian insulin and IGF-l signaling cascade, reduces Al31-42 toxicity [35]. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by the two downstream transcripÂ­ tion factors, DAF-16 and HSF-l (heat shock transcription factor-!) [132}. DAF-\6 encodes a forkhead transcription factor [133, 134], which translocates into the nucleus [135], and modulates transcription when DAF-2 signaling is abroÂ­ gated . The mammalian DAF-16 orthologs are Foxol, 3, and 4 [136). In the mammalian system the IR/IGF-1 R induces phosphorylation of Foxo I and triggers its translocation from the nucleus. The DAF-2 pathway reduces A ,_42 toxicity by two possible mechanisms of detoxification [35]: The first detoxification route leads to disaggregation of the toxic oliÂ­ gomer that is positively regulated by HSF-1 and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptides. The second mechanism mediates the formation of low toxic, high molecular weight aggregates from high toxic low molecular weight aggregates, which is positively regulated by DAF-!6. Both detoxificaÂ­ tion mechanisms are negatively regulated by DAF-2 signalÂ­ ing."

Similar findings were seen in Drosophila melanogaster where insulin signaling is mediated via chico the ortholog of human IRS.

We found that under physiological conditions IDE is secreted at high levels from the microglial cells, and degrades Abeta extracellularly [73].

IDE from brain homogenates degrades different forms of Abeta: Abeta40, Abeta42 and an Abeta mutant in one type of AD (Dutch Variant 1-40 Q) [61] and [71].

SET Evidence = "As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA.

GRN has also been directly implicated in frontotemporal dementia and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, GRN regulation expression is poorly understood. A high-throughput experimental microRNA assay showed that GRN is the strongest target for miR-107 in human H4 neuroglioma cells. miR-107 has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and sequence elements in the open reading frame-rather than the 3' untranslated region-of GRN mRNA are recognized by miR-107 and are highly conserved among vertebrate species. To better understand the mechanism of this interaction, FLAG-tagged Argonaute constructs were used following miR-107 transfection. GRN mRNA interacts preferentially with Argonaute 2. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that regulation of GRN by miR-107 may be functionally important. Glucose supplementation in cultured cells that leads to increased miR-107 levels also results in decreased GRN expression, including changes in cell compartmentation and decreased secretion of GRN protein. This effect was eliminated following miR-107 transfection. We also tested a mouse model where miR-107 has been shown to be down-regulated. In brain tissue subjacent to 1.0 mm depth controlled cortical impact, surviving hippocampal neurons show decreased miR-107 with augmentation of neuronal GRN expression.

Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture. In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2. Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and amyloid-beta-42 (Abeta42) peptide-stressed HAG cells. NF-κB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter. The NF-κB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated. Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected. These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1beta+Abeta42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-κB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-κB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response. The interactive signaling of NF-κB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro-inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. The combinatorial use of NF-κB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling."

Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects beta-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease."

Using reporter assays, we confirmed that, in human cell cultures, miR-101 significantly reduced the expression of a reporter under control of APP 3'-UTR. Mutation of predicted site 1, but not site 2, eliminated this reporter response. Delivery of miR-101 directly to human HeLa cells significantly reduced APP levels and this effect was eliminated by co-transfection with a miR-101 antisense inhibitor. Delivery of a specific target protector designed to blockade the interaction between miR-101 and its functional target site within APP 3'-UTR enhanced APP levels in HeLa. Therefore, endogenous miR-101 regulates expression of APP in human cells via a specific site located within its 3'-UTR. Finally, we demonstrate that, across a series of human cell lines, highest expression of miR-101 levels was observed in model NT2 neurons."

We find that many plasticity-associated genes contain predicted miR-485 binding sites and further identify the presynaptic protein SV2A as a target of miR-485. miR-485 negatively regulated dendritic spine density, postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) clustering, and surface expression of GluR2. Furthermore, miR-485 overexpression reduced spontaneous synaptic responses and transmitter release, as measured by miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) analysis and FM 1-43 staining. SV2A knockdown mimicked the effects of miR-485, and these effects were reversed by SV2A overexpression. Moreover, 5 d of increased synaptic activity induced homeostatic changes in synaptic specializations that were blocked by a miR-485 inhibitor. Our findings reveal a role for this previously uncharacterized miRNA and the presynaptic protein SV2A in homeostatic plasticity and nervous system development, with possible implications in neurological disorders (e.g., Huntington and Alzheimer's disease), where miR-485 has been found to be dysregulated."

Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood.

We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender.

The aim of the present study was to uncover novel potential miR-124 targets and shed light on its function in the cellular AD model. MiR-124 expression was steadily altered when its mimic and inhibitor were transfected in vitro. The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Abeta neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD."

SET Evidence = "Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulating in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients is believed to be the main pathophysiologcal cause of the disease. Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) protects the brain from the production of the Abeta. Meanwhile, dysregulation or aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely documented in AD patients. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-144, which was previously reported to be increased in elderly primate brains and AD patients, significantly decreased activity of the luciferase reporter containing the ADAM10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and suppressed the ADAM10 protein level, whereas the miR-144 inhibitor led to an increase of the luciferase activity. The negative regulation caused by miR-144 was strictly dependent on the binding of the miRNA to its recognition element in the ADAM10 3'-UTR. Moreover, we also showed that activator protein-1 regulates the transcription of miR-144 and the up-regulation of miR-144 at least partially induces the suppression of the ADAM10 protein in the presence of Abeta. In addition, we found that miR-451, a miRNA processed from a single gene locus with miR-144, is also involved in the regulation of ADAM10 expression. Taken together, our data therefore demonstrate miR-144/451 is a negative regulator of the ADAM10 protein and suggest a mechanistic role for miR-144/451 in AD pathogenesis."

Tau phosphorylation occurs mainly at proline-directed Ser/Thr sites, which are targeted by protein kinases such as GSK3beta and Cdk5. We reported previously that dephosphorylation of Tau at Cdk5-mediated sites was enhanced by Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that stimulates dephosphorylation at proline-directed sites by protein phosphatase 2A. Pin1 deficiency is suggested to cause Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease. Up to the present, Pin1 binding was only shown for two Tau phosphorylation sites (Thr-212 and Thr-231) despite the presence of many more hyperphosphorylated sites. Here, we analyzed the interaction of Pin1 with Tau phosphorylated by Cdk5-p25 using a GST pulldown assay and Biacore approach. We found that Pin1 binds and stimulates dephosphorylation of Tau at all Cdk5-mediated sites (Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-235, and Ser-404). Furthermore, FTDP-17 mutant Tau (P301L or R406W) showed slightly weaker Pin1 binding than non-mutated Tau, suggesting that FTDP-17 mutations induce hyperphosphorylation by reducing the interaction between Pin1 and Tau."

Thus, it is concluded that alpha-SN functions as a connecting mediator for tau and GSK-3beta, resulting in GSK-3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. Because the expression of alpha-SN is promoted by oxidative stress, the accumulation of alpha-SN induced by such stress may directly induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau by GSK-3beta.

We identified miR-16 and miR-132 as putative endogenous modulators of neuronal tau phosphorylation and tau exon 10 splicing, respectively. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been implicated in cell survival and function, whereas changes in miR-16/132 levels correlate with tau pathology in human neurodegenerative disorders.

SET Evidence = "Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-beta. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis."

We employed a lentivirally transduced monocyte cell line (THP1-155) containing an inducible miR-155 transgene to show that endogenous levels of SMAD2 protein were decreased after sustained overexpression of miR-155. This decrease in SMAD2 led to a reduction in both TGF-beta-induced SMAD-2 phosphorylation and SMAD-2-dependent activation of the expression of the CAGA(12)LUC reporter plasmid. Overexpression of miR-155 altered the cellular responses to TGF-beta by changing the expression of a set of genes that is involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Our study provides firm evidence of a role for miR-155 in directly repressing SMAD2 expression, and our results demonstrate the relevance of one of the two predicted target sites in SMAD2 3'-UTR. Altogether, our data uncover an important role for miR-155 in modulating the cellular response to TGF-beta with possible implications in several human diseases where homeostasis of TGF-beta might be altered."

Early studies suggested that alpha-secretase is a membrane-bound endoprotease which cleaves APP primarily at the plasma membrane. Using proteinase inhibitor profiling, it was determined that alpha-secretase is a zinc metalloproteinase. Several members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family possess alpha-secretase-like activity and three of them have been suggested as the alpha-secretase: ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17. Like APP, they are also type-I transmembrane proteins.A dramatically reduced ADAM10 protein level in the platelets of sporadic AD patients was also found to correlate with the significantly decreased sAPPalpha levels found in their platlets and cerebrospinal fluid and the reduced aclpha-secretase activity in the temporal cortex homogenates of AD patients . These studies strongly suggest that ADAM10 is the constitutive alpha-secretase that is active at the cell surface, though there may be some functional redundancy in alpha-cleavage among the ADAM family."

SET Evidence = "We found that miRs 18 and 124a reduced GR-mediated events in addition to decreasing GR protein levels. miR reporter assays revealed binding of miR-124a to the 3' untranslated region of GR. In correspondence, the activation of the GR-responsive gene glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper was strongly impaired by miR-124a and -18 overexpression. Although miR-18 is expressed widely throughout the body, expression of miR-124a is restricted to the brain. Endogenous miR-124a up-regulation during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells was associated with a decreasing amount of GR protein levels and reduced activity of luciferase reporter constructs bearing GR 3' untranslated regions. Furthermore, we show that miR-124a expression varies over time during the stress hyporesponsive period, a neonatal period when GC signaling is modulated. Our findings demonstrate a potential role for miRs in the regulation of cell type-specific responsiveness to GCs, as may occur during critical periods of neuronal development."

Neither DMAT nor KN93 alone had any statistically significant effect on dendritic IR and NMDAR levels (Fig.2E).

Furthermore, iron treatments increase the levels of FTL, PEN-2 and PS1 NTF and promote gamma-secretase-mediated NICD production.

By contrast, gene expression profiling of individual cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons aspirated from AD tissue revealed that GAL hyperinnervation positively regulates mRNAs that promote CBF neuronal function and survival. GAL also exerts neuroprotective effects in rodent models of neurotoxicity. These data support the growing concept that GAL overexpression preserves CBF neuron function, which may in turn delay the onset of symptoms of AD.

SET Evidence = "Seladin-1 was considered a novel neuroprotective factor, because of its anti-apoptotic activity. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that seladin-1 has also enzymatic activity [3-beta-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase, (DHCR24)], which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. The amount of membrane cholesterol may play an important role both in protecting neuronal cells against toxic insults and in inhibiting the production of beta-amyloid. We demonstrated that seladin-1 overexpression increases the amount of membrane cholesterol and induces resistance against beta-amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a specific inhibitor of DHCR24 increased cell vulnerability. We also hypothesized that seladin-1 might be a mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogens. We first demonstrated that, in human fetal neuroepithelial cells (FNC), 17beta-estradiol, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert protective effects against beta-amyloid toxicity and oxidative stress. In addition, these molecules significantly increased the expression of seladin-1 and the amount of cell cholesterol. Then, we showed that, upon seladin-1 silencing, the protective effects of estrogens were abolished, thus indicating this factor as a fundamental mediator of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, at least in FNC cells. Furthermore, we detected the presence of functionally active half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. Overall, our results indicate that seladin-1 may be viewed as a multi-faceted protein, which conjugates both the neuroprotective properties of estrogens and the important functions of cholesterol in maintaining brain homeostasis"

SET Evidence = "Several components in the Wnt signaling pathway, including beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, have been implied in AD pathogenesis. Here, mRNA brain levels from five-month-old tg-ArcSwe and nontransgenic mice were compared using Affymetrix microarray analysis. With surprisingly small overall changes, Wnt signaling was the most affected pathway with altered expression of nine genes in tg-ArcSwe mice. When analyzing mRNA levels of these genes in human brain, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), were increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (P < .05). Furthermore, no clear differences in TCF7L2 and MYC mRNA were found in brains with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, suggesting that altered regulation of these Wnt-related genes could be specific to AD. Finally, mRNA levels of three neurogenesis markers were analyzed. Increased mRNA levels of dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 were observed in AD brain, suggesting that altered Wnt signaling pathway regulation may signify synaptic rearrangement or neurogenesis."

Significant elevations in leptin levels in both CSF and hippocampal tissue of AD patients, compared with age-matched control cases, indicate a physiological up-regulation of leptin in AD. However, the level of leptin receptor mRNA decreased in AD brain and the leptin receptor protein was localized to neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting a severe discontinuity in the leptin signaling pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that leptin resistance in the hippocampus may play a role in the characteristic changes associated with the disease. These findings are the first to demonstrate such dysregulated leptin-signaling circuitry and provide novel insights into the possible role of aberrant leptin signaling in AD. In this study, increased leptin was found in CSF and hippocampus in Alzheimer disease indicating its physiological up-regulation, yet leptin receptor mRNA was decreased and leptin receptor protein was localized to neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting a discontinuity in the leptin signaling pathway. The lack of leptin signaling within degenerating neurons may represent a novel neuronal leptin resistance in Alzheimer disease. "

SET Evidence = "We have previously demonstrated that Leptin reduces extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) protein both in vitro and in vivo, and intracellular tau phosphorylation in vitro. Further, we have shown that these effects are dependent on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro. Herein, we investigated downstream effectors of AMPK signaling directly linked to tau phosphorylation. One such target, of relevance to Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be GSK-3beta, which has been shown to be inactivated by Leptin. We therefore dissected the role of GSK-3beta in mediating Leptin's ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells. Our data suggest that Leptin regulates tau phosphorylation through a pathway involving both AMPK and GSK-3beta. This was based on the following: Leptin and the cell-permeable AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), reduced tau phosphorylation at AD-relevant sites similarly to the GSK-3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl). Further, this reduction of tau phosphorylation was mimicked by the downregulation of GSK-3beta, achieved using siRNA technology and antagonized by the ectopic overexpression of GSK-3beta. "

However, we find that a selective cGMP phosphodiesterase (cGMP-PDE) inhibitor (dipyridamole) is able to interactively block the enhanced vasoconstriction as well as the opposition to relaxation induced by Abeta, suggesting that Abeta could effect the activity of this enzyme. Cyclic GMP levels, but not cAMP concentrations, are reduced after Abeta treatment of rat aortic rings, further substantiating this hypothesis."

SET Evidence = "Cerebrolysin is a peptide mixture with neurotrophic effects that might reduce the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrolysin might reduce amyloid deposition by regulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation or by modulating APP expression, maturation, or processing. To investigate these possibilities, APP tg mice were treated for 6 months with Cerebrolysin and analyzed in the water maze, followed by RNA, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy analysis of full-length (FL) APP and its fragments, beta-secretase (BACE1), and Abeta-degrading enzymes [neprilysin (Nep) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)]. Consistent with previous studies, Cerebrolysin ameliorated the performance deficits in the spatial learning portion of the water maze and reduced the synaptic pathology and amyloid burden in the brains of APP tg mice. These effects were associated with reduced levels of FL APP and APP C-terminal fragments, but levels of BACE1, Notch1, Nep, and IDE were unchanged. In contrast, levels of active cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK-3beta; but not stress-activated protein kinase-1 (SAPK1)], kinases that phosphorylate APP, were reduced. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin reduced the levels of phosphorylated APP and the accumulation of APP in the neuritic processes. Taken together, these results suggest that Cerebrolysin might reduce AD-like pathology in the APP tg mice by regulating APP maturation and transport to sites where Abeta protein is generated."

Due to the conable structural similarity between cholinesterases (ChE) and CEs, we have assessed the ability of a series of ChE inhibitors to modulate the activity of the human liver (hCE1) and the human intestinal CE (hiCE) isoforms. For example, rivastigmine resulted in greater than 95% inhibition of hiCE that was irreversible under the conditions used. Hence, the administration of esterified drugs, in combination with these carbamates, may inadvertently result in decreased hydrolysis of the former, thereby limiting their efficacy. Given that hCE1 and the ChEs demonstrate considerable structural homology, we assessed the ability of panel of known AChE and BChE inhibitors to modulate CE activity. However, because carbamate-containing compounds can irreversibly inhibit esterases [3], we evaluated the ability of a selected panel of these molecules to inactivate the human CEs. All of the compounds, with the exception of donepezil, demonstrated activity toward hiCE (Table 3). Indeed for tolserine and rivastigmine, significant loss of enzyme activity was observed."

SET Evidence = "In this study, we investigated whether AS-IV could prevent Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting the mPTP opening. The results showed that pretreatment of AS-IV significantly increased the viability of neuronal cells, reduced apoptotic process, decreased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial superoxide in the presence of Abeta1-42. In addition, pretreatment of AS-IV inhibited the mPTP opening, rescued mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced ATP generation, improved the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and blocked cytochrome c release from mitochondria in Abeta1-42 rich milieu. Moreover, pretreatment of AS-IV reduced the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in an Abeta1-42 rich environment. These data indicate that AS-IV prevents Abeta1-42-induced SK-N-SH cell apoptosis via inhibiting the mPTP opening and ROS generation."

SET Evidence = "We have previously reported that CysLT1R activation is involved in Abeta generation. In this study, we investigated rescuing effect of CysLT1R antagonist montelukast on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in primary neurons. Our data showed that Abeta1-42 elicited a marked increase of CysLT1R expression in primary mouse neurons. This increment of CysLT1R expression was accompanied by increases of inflammatory factors such as NF-ÎºB p65, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) as well as pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptotic process protein Bcl-2 reduction. This observation was confirmed with treatment of montelukast, a selective CysLT1R antagonist, which had significant effect on Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, blockade of CysLT1R with montelukast reversed Abeta1-42-mediated increase of CysLT1R expression, and concomitant changes of the pro-inflammatory factors and the apoptotic process-related proteins. The results demonstrate that montelukast rescued neurons against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation and apoptosis by down-regulating CysLT1R-mediated NF-ÎºB signaling, suggesting that CysLT1R may be a potential target for AD, and its antagonist may have beneficial effects for treatment of AD."

The major apoptotic pathway is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction with the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, and subsequently of caspase-3. It has been suggested that caspase-3 is an ultimate effectors caspase whose activation leads to switch on the apoptotic cascade.

However, p35, which potently inhibits capase-3, does not slow disease progression in mouse ALS. There are two explanations for this apparent discrepancy. Since caspase-9 remains active in the presence of p35, procaspase-3 may be continuously processed into active caspase-3, finally overriding inhibition by p35. Alternatively, caspase-9 may utilize a substrate other than caspase-3, leading to caspase-3-independent cell death"

SET Evidence = "Caspase-9 activation is mainly triggered by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which occurs at the asymptomatic stage prior to disease onset (Guebetagan et al., 2001). Cytochrome c, together with ATP/ADP, Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, forms a complex termed `apoptosome', in which caspase-9 is activated. Caspase-9 then cleaves procaspase-3 to generate active caspase-3. Both caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleave procaspase-9 to form an `amplication loop' of caspase-9 activation. XIAP does not inhibit `apoptosome' formation and its upstream events, but suppresses the downstream `amplibetacation loop' by inhibition of caspase-9 and -3. Therefore, the activation of caspase-9 preceded by cytochrome c release can occur in the presence of a potent caspase-9 inhibitor XIAP and be considered an indicator of disease onset, regardless of the level of caspase-9."

IGF-I is a critical promoter of brain development and neuronal survival and plays a role in neuronal rescue during degenerative diseases.When a cholinesterase inhibitor as rivastigmine, a drug for AD, is acutely administered the area under the curve of the GH response to GHRH doubled, showing that rivastigmine is a powerful drug to enhance GH release. TNFÎ± production may promote neurodegeneration not through direct killing of neurons but rather through inhibition of IGF-I survival signalling"

## SET Evidence = "Abnormalities in the processing of amyloid precursor protein to amyloid-beta (Abeta) are causal factors, and the presence of the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based, at least in part, on these genetics, the potential structural and functional interactions between these two proteins are the focus of our research. To understand the nature of the physical interactions between apoE and Abeta, we initially utilized gel-shift assays to demonstrate that native apoE2 and E3 (associated with lipid particles) form an SDS-stable complex with Abeta that is more abundant than the apoE4:Abeta complex. We further demonstrated that exogenous apoE3 but not E4 prevents Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by a process that requires apoE receptors. In addition, both exogenous apoE3 and E4 prevent Abeta-induced, glial-mediated inflammation, also via a process that requires apoE receptors. These functional effects all occur at a molar ratio of apoE to Abeta of 1:30. Because the biological activities for both apoE and Abeta are profoundly influenced by their isoform and conformation, respectively, we further investigated the idea that apoE3 and E4 differentially interact with particular aggregation species of Abeta1-42. Our overall hypothesis is that apoE has two general functions in relation to Abeta. First, apoE interacts with oligomeric Abeta via an apoE receptor-mediated process to inhibit neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation (apoE3 > apoE4) a process possibly related to binding and clearance of apoE3:oligomer complexes. Second, apoE facilitates the deposition of Abeta as amyloid (apoE4 > apoE3). We will continue to investigate the effect of apoE isoform and Abeta conformation on the structural and functional interactions between these two proteins in relation to the pathogenesis of AD."

## Apolipoprotein E (apoE) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is extensively sialylated, and the sialylation of certain proteins is known to pmodulate their biological function. We investigated the effects of a sialic acid moiety of apoE on the apoE-Abeta interaction using the surface plasmon resonance assay. Further, we established a method for the determination of the sialic acid content of CSF apoE, and carried out a more detailed characterization of CSF apoE-containing lipoproteins. The binding avidity of asialo-apoE3 was approximately 50% of that of sialo-apoE3 (p<0.0001). The binding avidity of the apoE-containing lipoproteins for Abeta reduced after neuraminidase treatment. The sialic acid levels in the CSF apoE-containing lipoprotein fractions were 5.3 +/- 1.3% of the total CSF sialic acid, and were correlated with the CSF apoE concentrations. However, the ratios of sialic acid to apoE were inversely proportional to the CSF lipid concentrations. The lipoprotein particle sizes were larger when the ratios of sialic acid to CSF apoE were greater. The sialic acid moiety of the apoE molecules affects the interaction of apoE with Abeta and the formation of apoE-containing lipoprotein particles. The posttranslational pmodification of apoE, such as the presence of sialic acid moieties, may be involved in the regulation of lipid transport to the brain.

SET Evidence = "Notch2 was identified as a potential APP binding partner based on mass spectrometry analysis of APP complexes immunopurified from neurons. To confirm the interaction between Notch2 and APP, we carried out immunoprecipitation studies in HEK275 cells transiently expressing full-length Notch2 using Notch2 antibodies. The results indicated that APP and Notch2 interact in mammalian cells, and confirmed our initial findings. Interestingly, Notch1 also coimmunoprecipitated with APP, suggesting that APP and Notch family members may engage in intermolecular cross talk to modulate cell function. Finally, cotransfection of APP/CFP and Notch2/YFP into COS cells revealed that these two proteins colocalize on the plasma membrane."

SET Evidence = "Recently, Notch receptors have been hypothesized to play a role in neurodegeneration and in particular in Alzheimer's disease (Notch1) and CADASIL (Notch3). Here we show that another family member (Notch2) is constitutively expressed in adult mouse hippocampus in DG and not in CA1 and CA3 neurons. Treatment with kainic acid resulted in marked Notch2 induction in pyramidal neurons of CA1 and in a subpopulation of CA3 neurons surviving the lesion and protein expression was still detectable 6 weeks after drug treatment. These results suggest Notch2 involvement in the response of postmitotic neurons to excitotoxic stimuli."

SET Evidence = "To investigate potential homodimeric and heterodimeric interactions of APP and Notch2 (N2), we have visualized the subcellular localization of the APP/N2 complexes formed in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis. BiFC was accomplished by fusing the N-terminal fragment or the C-terminal fragment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to APP, N2, and a C-terminally truncated form of N2.When expressed in COS-7 cells, these tagged proteins alone did not produce a fluorescent signal. The tagged APP homodimer produced a weak fluorescent signal, while neither full-length N2, nor a truncated N2 alone, produced a visible signal, suggesting that N2 receptors do not form homodimers. The strongest fluorescent signal was obtained with co-expression of the C-terminal fragment of YFP fused to APP and the N-terminal fragment of YFP fused to the truncated form of N2. This heterodimer localized to plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi and other compartments. The results were confirmed and quantified by flow cytometry. The BiFC method of specifically visualizing APP/Notch interactions can be applied to study APP and Notch signaling during development, aging and neurodegeneration."

SET Evidence = "The amyloid precursor protein is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that has been long implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease but its normal biological function has remained elusive despite extensive effort. We have previously reported the identification of Notch2 as an amyloid precursor protein interacting protein in E18 rat neurons. Here, we sought to reveal the physiologic consequences of this interaction. We report a functional relationship between amyloid precursor protein and Notch1, which does not affect Delta ligand binding. First, we observed interactions between the amyloid precursor protein and Notch in mouse embryonic stem cells lacking both presenilin 1 and presenilin 2, the active proteolytic components of the gamma-secretase complex, suggesting that these two transmembrane proteins can interact in the absence of presenilin. Next, we demonstrated that the amyloid precursor protein affects Notch signaling by using Notch-dependent luciferase assays in two cell lines, the human embryonic kidney 293 and the monkey kidney, COS7. We found that the amyloid precursor protein exerts opposing effects on Notch signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 vs. COS7 cells. Finally, we show that more Notch Intracellular Domain is found in the nucleus in the presence of exogenous amyloid precursor protein or its intracellular domain, suggesting the mechanism by which the amyloid precursor protein affects Notch signaling in certain cells. Our results provide evidence of potentially important communications between the amyloid precursor protein and Notch."

We found that expression of mTOR/p-mTOR and its downstream targets S6/p-S6 and Raptor/p-Raptor were expressed in the control and AD hippocampus. The expression levels of these signaling molecules were significantly increased in the hippocampus at the severe stages of AD, compared to controls and other stages of AD. Interestingly, Rictor expression level was unaltered. In addition, RagC was increased in the hippocampus at the early, moderate, and severe stages of AD.

The stable expression of 17A in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells induces the synthesis of an alternative splicing isoform that abolish GABA B2 intracellular signaling (i.e., inhibition of cAMP accumulation and activation of K(+) channels). Indeed, 17A is expressed in human brain, and we report that it is upregulated in cerebral tissues derived from Alzheimer disease patients. We demonstrate that 17A expression in neuroblastoma cells enhances the secretion of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and the Abeta x-42/Î‘beta x-40 peptide ratio and that its synthesis is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli."

SET Evidence = "Apoptosis pathways and DNA synthesis are activated in neurons in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the signaling mechanisms that mediate these events have not been defined. We show that expression of familial AD (FAD) mutants of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in primary neurons in culture causes apoptosis and DNA synthesis. Both the apoptosis and the DNA synthesis are mediated by the p21 activated kinase PAK3, a serine-threonine kinase that interacts with APP. A dominant-negative kinase mutant of PAK3 inhibits the neuronal apoptosis and DNA synthesis; this effect is abolished by deletion of the PAK3 APP-binding domain or by coexpression of a peptide representing this binding domain. The involvement of PAK3 specifically in FAD APP-mediated apoptosis rather than in general apoptotic pathways is suggested by the facts that a dominant-positive mutant of PAK3 does not alone cause neuronal apoptosis and that the dominant-negative mutant of PAK3 does not inhibit chemically induced apoptotic process."

SET Evidence = "Cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase precludes Abeta generation as the cleavage site is within the Abeta domain (at the Lys16-Leu17 bond), and releases a large soluble ectodomain of APP called sAPPalpha. Early studies suggested that alpha-secretase is a membrane-bound endoprotease which cleaves APP primarily at the plasma membrane. Using proteinase inhibitor profiling, it was determined that alpha-secretase is a zinc metalloproteinase. Several members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family possess alpha-secretase-like activity and three of them have been suggested as the alpha-secretase: ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17. Like APP, they are also type-I transmembrane proteins.A dramatically reduced ADAM10 protein level in the platelets of sporadic AD patients was also found to correlate with the significantly decreased sAPPalpha levels found in their platlets and cerebrospinal fluid and the reduced alpha-secretase activity in the temporal cortex homogenates of AD patients . These studies strongly suggest that ADAM10 is the constitutive alpha-secretase that is active at the cell surface, though there may be some functional redundancy in alpha-cleavage among the ADAM family."

SET Evidence = "The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is essential for synaptic function, plasticity and neuronal survival. At the axon terminal, when BDNF binds to its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), the signal is propagated along the axon to the cell body, via retrograde transport, regulating gene expression and neuronal function. Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early impairments in synaptic function that may result in part from neurotrophin signaling deficits. Growing evidence suggests that soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) assemblies cause synaptic dysfunction by disrupting both neurotransmitter and neurotrophin signaling. Furthermore, Abeta oligomers alone impair BDNF retrograde transport. Thus, Abeta reduces BDNF signaling by impairing axonal transport and this may underlie the synaptic dysfunction observed in AD."

Abeta-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, Abeta may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival."

Our data suggest that a key mechanism mediating the deficit involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme that functions to regulate cellular ubiquitin. Abeta-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, Abeta may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival."

The S100B/RAGE-dependent activation of diaphanous-1/Rac1/JNK/AP-1, Ras/Rac1/NF-kB and Src/Ras/PI3K/RhoA/diaphanous-1 results in the up-regulation of expression of the chemokines, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL12, whose release and activity are required for S100B to stimulate microglia migration.

SET Evidence = "In particular,in receptor TK, tyrosine residue can be phosphorylated to generate the NPXpY motif, which represents a docking sitefor several intracellular adaptor proteins through the phosphortyrosine-binding domain (PTB). Similarly, the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 can bind AbetaPP (or its CTFs) in the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine in this motif. However, AbetaPP (or its CTFs) and the AbetaPP-related proteins, APLP1 and APLP2, can also interact with several other signalling proteins, including X11, Fe65, mDab, c-Abl, JIP-1, and Numb, independently of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the YENPTY motif. From a functional point of view, the interaction between the neuron-specific adaptor protein Fe65 and AbetaPP via the second PTB domain of Fe65 was shown to modulate AbetaPP processing, favoring the generation of Abeta and AbetaPP trafficking, in several cell lines. Another adaptor that binds to AbetaPP is mDAB. It is a protein related to the Reelin subgraph and interacting with YENPTY motif through a PTB domain. mDAB is active during embryogenesis, where it regulates the position of neurons in the brain laminar structure, and mDAB binding increases the amounts of mature AbetaPP and Abeta formation. On the contrary, X11 stabilizes AbetaPP conformation in membrane, inhibiting Abeta secretion in cultured cells, likely impairing AbetaPP trafficking to sites containing active gamma-secretase complexes. JIP's are member of JNK-scaffolding family proteins kinases, implicated in different signal pathway, including neuronal apoptotic process. JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 bind to the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature AbetaPP and decreases the AbetaPP ectodomain, Abeta40/Abeta42 and CTFs abundance.All these observations suggest that some of these protein-protein interactions may play a role in the modulation of the amyloidogenic pathway and thus might have a role in neurodegeneration."

The increased phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2, often described in AD brain, is also observed in thrombin-activated astrocytes, suggesting that, in this model, ERK1/2 may be activated by AbetaPP through ShcA. These data give prominence to the biological importance of AbetaPP phosphorylation for its functions and the regulation of intracellular adaptor binding as events responsible for the induction of glial-associated mitogenic pathway. Furthermore, ERK1/2, activated by Abeta in vitro, plays a role in AbetaPP processing and phosphorylates Tau in a PHF-Tau similar manner.

SET Evidence = "Abeta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer (AD) brains are surrounded by severe dendritic and axonal changes, including local spine loss, axonal swellings and distorted neurite trajectories. Whether and how plaques induce these neuropil abnormalities remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that oligomeric assemblies of Abeta, seen in the periphery of plaques, mediate the neurodegenerative phenotype of AD by triggering activation of the enzyme GSK-3beta, which in turn appears to inhibit a transcriptional program mediated by CREB. We detect increased activity of GSK-3beta after exposure to oligomeric Abeta in neurons in culture, in the brain of double transgenic APP/tau mice and in AD brains. Activation of GSK-3beta, even in the absence of Abeta, is sufficient to produce a phenocopy of Abeta-induced dendritic spine loss in neurons in culture, while pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3beta prevents spine loss and increases expression of CREB-target genes like BDNF. Of note, in transgenic mice GSK-3beta inhibition ameliorated plaque-related neuritic changes and increased CREB-mediated gene expression. Moreover, GSK-3beta inhibition robustly decreased the oligomeric Abeta load in the mouse brain. All these findings support the idea that GSK3beta is aberrantly activated by the presence of Abeta, and contributes, at least in part, to the neuronal anatomical derangement associated with Abeta plaques in AD brains and to Abeta pathology itself."

In the present study, we show that the PS1-mediated (or possibly the PS2-mediated) signal is essential for the APP-mediated death in a gamma-secretase-independent manner and vice versa. MOCA (modifier of cell adhesion), which was originally identified as being a PS- and Rac1-binding protein, is a common downstream constituent of these neuronal death signals. Detailed molecular analysis indicates that MOCA is a key molecule of the AD-relevant neuronal death signals that links the PS-mediated death signal with the APP-mediated death signal at a point between Rac1 [or Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42)] and ASK1 (apoptotic process signal-regulating kinase 1)."

LMP is a potentially lethal event because the ectopic presence of lysosomal proteases in the cytosol causes digestion of vital proteins and the activation of additional hydrolases including caspases. This latter process is usually mediated indirectly, through a cascade in which LMP causes the proteolytic activation of Bid (which is cleaved by the two lysosomal cathepsins B and D). The Bid activation then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosome-dependent caspase activation [19]. However, massive LMP often results in cell death without caspase activation, which may adopt a subapoptotic or necrotic appearance.

SET Evidence = "Reverse signaling through the ephrinB ligands is important for several morphogenetic events, such as axon guidance, neuronal plasticity, spine maturation, and synaptogenesis. Signaling is initiated by binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation via an unclear mechanism. Here we show that this mechanism involves presenilin1 (PS1)/gamma-secretase regulation of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk binding protein (PAG/Cbp), an adaptor protein that controls the activity of Src kinases.Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot of mouse primary neuronal and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell extracts overexpressing PAG/Cbp, we show that EphB2 induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp in a gamma-secretase-dependent manner. In these cells, PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation is promoted by the PS1/gamma-secretase-produced fragment of ephrinB2 cleavage (ephrinB2/CTF2), which forms complexes with PAG/Cbp when introduced exogenously. EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB2 depends on PAG/Cbp because EphB2 cannot increase ephrinB2 phosphorylation in cells treated with anti-PAG siRNA or in PAG/Cbp-knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, in contrast to WT PS1, familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) PS1 mutants expressed in PS1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibited both the EphB2-induced dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and the phosphorylation of ephrinB2. PS1 FAD mutations may thus inhibit the function of ephrinB in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease."

Nevertheless, the amplitude of baseline transmission remains remarkably constant even though low frequency stimulation is also associated with an NMDAR-dependent influx of Ca(2+) into dendritic spines. We show here that an interaction between C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and NMDARs controls the Src-dependent regulation of NMDAR activity. Csk associates with the NMDAR signaling complex in the adult brain, inhibiting the Src-dependent potentiation of NMDARs in CA1 neurons and attenuating the Src-dependent induction of long-term potentiation. Csk associates directly with Src-phosphorylated NR2 subunits in vitro. An inhibitory antibody for Csk disrupts this physical association, potentiates NMDAR mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents, and induces long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses. Thus, Csk serves to maintain the constancy of baseline excitatory synaptic transmission by inhibiting Src kinase-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus"

SET Evidence = "Background and Objective: Could a normal - but persistent - stress response to impeded axonal transport lead to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Our results offer an affirmative answer, suggesting a mechanism for the abnormal production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), triggered by the slowed axonal transport at old age. We hypothesize that Abeta precursor protein (APP) is a sensor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that detects, and signals to the nucleus, abnormalities in axonal transport. When persistently activated, due to chronically slowed-down transport, this signaling pathway leads to accumulation of Abeta within the ER. Methods and Results: We tested this hypothesis with the neuronal cell line CAD. We show that, normally, a fraction of APP is transported into neurites by recruiting kinesin-1 via the adaptor protein, Fe65. Under conditions that block kinesin-1-dependent transport, APP, Fe65 and kinesin-1 accumulate in the soma, and form a complex at the ER.This complex recruits active c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates APP at Thr(668). This phosphorylation increases the cleavage of APP by the amyloidogenic pathway, which generates Abeta within the ER lumen, and releases Fe65 into the cytoplasm. Part of the released Fe65 translocates into the nucleus, likely to initiate a gene transcription response to arrested transport. Prolonged arrest of kinesin-1-dependent transport could thus lead to accumulation and oligomerization of Abeta in the ER. Conclusion: These results support a model where the APP:Fe65 complex is a sensor at the ER for detecting the increased level of kinesin-1 caused by halted transport, which signals to the nucleus, while concomitantly generating an oligomerization-prone pool of Abeta in the ER. Our hypothesis could thus explain a pathogenic mechanism in AD."

Early studies suggested that alpha-secretase is a membrane-bound endoprotease which cleaves APP primarily at the plasma membrane. Using proteinase inhibitor profiling, it was determined that alpha-secretase is a zinc metalloproteinase. Several members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family possess alpha-secretase-like activity and three of them have been suggested as the alpha-secretase: ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17. Like APP, they are also type-I transmembrane proteins.A dramatically reduced ADAM10 protein level in the platelets of sporadic AD patients was also found to correlate with the significantly decreased sAPPalpha levels found in their platlets and cerebrospinal fluid and the reduced alpha-secretase activity in the temporal cortex homogenates of AD patients . These studies strongly suggest that ADAM10 is the constitutive alpha-secretase that is active at the cell surface, though there may be some functional redundancy in alpha-cleavage among the ADAM family."

SET Evidence = "Cellular uptake and degradation by glial cells is one means by which ABeta¸ may be cleared from the brain. In the current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation of ABeta¸ by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in ABeta¸ uptake, while increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of ABeta¸. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of ABeta¸ and facilitated the vesicular transport of ABeta¸ to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on ABeta¸ uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that ABeta¸ can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting an interaction between LDLR and ABeta¸ could be responsible for LDLR-mediated ABeta¸ uptake. Therefore, these results identify LDLR as a receptor that mediates ABeta¸ uptake and clearance by astrocytes, and provide evidence that increasing glial LDLR levels may promote ABeta¸ degradation within the brain"

SET Evidence = "The proposed amyloid-like conformation of peptide/protein hormones in secretory granules may explain the processes of granule formation including hormone selection, membrane surrounding as well as the inert hormone storage, and subsequently the release of hormones from the granules: It is proposed that in the Golgi, amyloid aggregation of the (pro)hormone is initiated spontaneously above a critical (pro)hormone concentration or/and in presence of helper molecules such as GAGs in parallel to a possible prohormone processing. Alternatively, since the prohormone may aggregate less into an amyloid entity than its hormone counterpart, the prohormone processing at critical hormone concentrations may initiate the aggregation. Since the formation of amyloid fibrils is amino acid sequence-specific, the initiated amyloid aggregation of the (pro)hormone is selective yielding granule cores composed of specific hormones only. Specific coaggregation of some hormones may be possible since some amyloid proteins are able to cross-seed. The amyloid aggregation sorts thereby the protein/peptide hormones into secretory granule cores, concentrates them to the highest density possible and excludes non-aggregation-prone constitutively secreted proteins. During the aggregation process the hormone amyloids get surrounded by membrane, separate from the golgi and form mature granules. The membrane attraction may be spontaneous since membrane binding seems to be an inherent property of amyloid aggregates. Alternatively, since the cross-ÃƒÅ¸ sheet represents a single structural epitope it may serve as a possible recognition motive of an unknown granule-recruiting membrane protein. Once the secretory granules are formed they can be stored for long durations since the amyloid entity provides a very stable depot. Upon signaling, secretory granules are secreted and the cross-ÃƒÅ¸ sheet structure of the amyloid enables a controlled release of monomeric, functional hormone, which might be supported by chaperones."

SET Evidence = "Insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin signaling: The underlying mechanism of neuronal survival with ABeta¸ is emerging. Neuronal synapses and astrocytes of memory-processing brain regions possess insulin receptors (IRs) [99] which when activated by insulin facilitate synaptic plasticity in normal brain [100]. IR and Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors consist of a-subunits and transmembrane ÃƒÅ¸-subunits. Binding of insulin or IGF-I to the a-subunit increases the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the ÃƒÅ¸-subunit, and causes autophosphorylation of the ÃƒÅ¸-subunit, thus triggering tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, as well as Shc [101] as an important pathway of cell survival. To protect against ABeta¸ toxicity, the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites create binding sites for various signal-transducing molecules containing Src homology-2 domain, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), thus activating PI3K/phosphoinostide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt (protein kinase B)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3a/-3ÃƒÅ¸ and Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways [101]. In normal brain, IGF-I and insulin promote glucose utilization, energy metabolism, and neuronal survival [102], largely through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ signaling [103, 104].Consistent with positive effects of insulin on synaptic plasticity [105], acute insulin treatment improved memory in rats [106] and also in normaladults and AD patients [107] by strongly activating ERK and Akt and blocking c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in a PI3K-dependent manner [108]. The mechanism involves many steps beginning with ABeta¸ activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors by locally produced IGF-1 or, possibly, ABeta¸ monomers may bind to IGF-1/insulin receptors, as already shown for ABeta¸ oligomers "

SET Evidence = "The PI3K/Akt signaling: PI3K, a membrane-associated second messenger protein, and its downstream kinase, Akt, are associated with neuronal survival [111] and plasticity [112] via activation of transcription pathways and protein synthesis. PI3K pathway, which required the activation of IGF-1/insulin receptors, is the most convincing prosurvival effect of ABeta¸42 monomers. The PI3K signaling pathway is important in the transmission of survival signals in many cell types including neurons [113, 114]. The PI3K-Akt signaling cascade, initiated by IRS, is phosphorylated by stimulated insulin- andIGF-receptor tyrosine kinases [115]. One of the kinases known to lie downstream of PI3K is Akt, which can be directly activated by products of PI3K [116] by promoting its phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308 [117]. Activated Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of substrates activating anti-apoptotic (survival) factors and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors [114, 117]. Certain proapoptotic mediators, such as the transcription factor forkhead (FOXO), the tau kinase GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, and the Bcl2 antagonist BAD proteins, are inactivated by Akt [118, 119]. Akt downregulates the activities of GSK-3a and GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ by phosphorylating the former at Ser21 and the latter at Ser9 [118]. Phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸, suppresses GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸-dependent phosphorylation of tau at residues overphosphorylated in AD and prevents apoptosis of confluent cells. Treatment of cortical neurons with ABeta¸42 monomers increased Ser9 phosphorylation (inhibition) of the Akt substrate, GSK- 3ÃƒÅ¸ [97]. Inhibition of GSK-3ÃƒÅ¸ promotes cell survival through a variety of mechanisms including a reduced degradation of ÃƒÅ¸-catenin, which then translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of protective genes [126]."

SET Evidence = "Extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 signaling (ERK1 and ERK2): The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of protein kinases is traditionally viewed as important kinases in transmitting extracellular membrane signals intothe nucleus. The 44 kDa ERK1 and 42 kDa ERK2 are members of the MAPK superfamily that specifically respond to ABeta¸ in brain cells [127]. ERK1 and ERK2 are known to be activated through dual phosphorylation by the MAPK/ERK on threonine and tyrosine in the Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence of the activation loop [128, 129]. ERK signaling is critical for memory and tightly regulated by many proteins. ERKs are critical for human learning as revealed by human mental retardation syndromes [130]. They are also known to contribute to molecular information processing in dendrites, to stabilize structural changes in dendritic spines and to interact with scaffolding and structural proteins at the synapse [131]. ERK is an important neuronal marker for activity through activation by cytosolic calcium and depolarization of the membrane [132, 133]. On phosphorylation and activation, ERKs phosphorylate other cytoplasmic effectors and are translocated into the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors such as Myc, Fos, Jun, and Elk1 [104, 134]. Direct substrates of the ERKs includetwo members of the RSK family of protein serine-threonine kinases, RSK1 and RSK2. The transcription factor CREB is phosphorylated on serine 133 in vivo by RSK2 in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells [135]. The dependence of CREB phosphorylation on activation of the ERK pathway is suggested by inhibition of ABeta¸-induced phosphorylation of CREB by piceatannol and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Other kinases, such as protein kinase A (PKA) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases [CAM kinases; 136] may also contribute to phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) in response to ABeta¸ but the complete inhibition of CREB phosphorylation by PD98059 suggests that the ERK pathway is the main signaling pathway elicited by ABeta¸ leading to transcriptional activation through CREB [137]. These data provide a mechanism by which ABeta¸ alters gene expression through the transcription factor CREB [137], possibly resulting in a ceiling of activation that limits further formation of new memories."

In addition, PKC activates ERK by interacting with Ras or Raf-1 [140] to initiate CREB phosphorylation. While PKC levels decline in AD [141], their activation restores K+ channel function in cells from AD patients [142].

The process implicates key protein effectors, such as CaMKs, MAPK/ERKs, and CREB. Properly controlled homeostasis of calcium signaling not only supports normal brain physiology but also maintains neuronal integrity and long-term cell survival. Ca2+ signaling pathways can suppress apoptosis and promote survival through two mechanistically distinct processes. One process involves the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway which promotes survival [147]. The other pathway requires the generation of calcium transients in the cell nucleus which offers long-lasting neuroprotection [146, 148]. Malfunctioning of calcium signaling to the cell nucleus may lead to neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death ."

SET Evidence = "Dysregulation of intracellular calcium signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease [150]. ABeta¸ is known to act through multiple targets [151] including Ca2+ channels and various receptors in membranes. Synthetic ABeta¸ binds to the calcium permeable nAChRs with high affinity [152]. ABeta¸42 administered in the low picomolar range activates nAChRs at presynaptic nerve endings of synaptosomes [83, 153]. Under normal conditions, activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABeta¸-induced increase in synaptic plasticity and memory [23]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the peptide with the nAChR. In addition, ABeta¸ enhances transmitter release by transient increase of glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal that results from brief periods of high frequency stimulation with Ca2+ buildup within the terminal that triggers mechanisms of short-term synaptic plasticity [154]."

ABeta¸ interacts directly with the recombinant L-type Ca2+ channel (a1C) subunit to increase Ca2+ channel protein at the cell membrane and hence increased Ca2+ conductance [80]. Within the TRPC subfamily, TRPC3 and 6 have been shown to protect cerebellar granule neurons against serum deprivationÃ¢â‚¬â€œinduced cell death in cultures and promote neuronal survival in rat brain [155]. A neuronal survival mechanism of ABeta¸ may also involve altered expression of K+ channels [80]. In cerebellar granule neurons, 24-h pre-incubation with 1 Ã‚ÂµM unaggregated ABeta¸ protein resulted in a 60% increase in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-type component of K+ current possibly reflecting Ca2+-mediated gene expression [156].

These kinases all phosphorylate CREB at a particular residue, serine 133 (Ser133) which is required for CREB-mediated transcription [157]. In contrast to CaMKs, ERKs cannot directly phosphorylate CREB. Two related RSKs and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases (MSKs) transmit the signal from activated ERKs to CREB [158]. CREB has been shown to be involved in certain types of hippocampal LTP as well as long-term memory, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis [159, 160]. Transcriptional activation of CREB recruits a multiprotein assembly called a transcriptional co-activator complex. These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity [161]. Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins is CREB binding protein (CBP) [162]. There is no direct evidence indicating how lower levels of ABeta¸ might initiate CREB phosphorylation principally by Ca2+ signaling and/or through PKA/Atk/ERK pathways."

SET Evidence = "Cholesterol transport: High cholesterol levels have been linked to overproduction of ABeta¸ and are a risk factor for AD. One of the physiological functions of ABeta¸ has been suggested to control cholesterol transport [167]. Prevalence of AD is reduced among people treated with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, statins [168, 169] and animal studies support these results [170]. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cholesterol modulates APP processing and affects APP mRNA expression [171]. Another mechanism is the increased binding of ABeta¸ to ApoE4 over non-E4 alleles. ApoE is a lipid and cholesterol transport protein responsible for the efflux of cholesterol from neurons to form stable complexes both in vitro and in vivo [172]. Allele ApoE4 is a major risk factor in AD [173]. This relationship might promote synaptogenesis, since in vitro studies have demonstrated that cholesterol released by astroglia increases synaptogenesis [174, 175] with resulting modulation of spike rates [176]. Together, this evidence indicates that one of the physiological functions of APP might be to control cholesterol movement across neuronal membranes [167]."

SET Evidence = "Antioxidant: The three histidine residues in ABeta¸ control the redox activity of iron, indicating that ABeta¸ is likely to be an important antioxidant. ABeta¸40 at 5 Ã‚ÂµM was found to protect primary neuronal cultures from the neurotoxicity of iron [94]. Nakamura et al. [177] found that ABeta¸40 or ABeta¸42 inhibits Fe3+ or Cu+2-catalyzed ascorbate oxidation and hydroxyl radical generation. Nanomolar concentrations of ABeta¸ can block neuronal apoptosis following oxidative damage, which suggests that ABeta¸ has a protective role against oxidative stress [178] and is essential for neuronal survival [28, 94]. Monomeric ABeta¸40 was found to protect neurons cultured in a medium containing 1.5 Ã‚ÂµM Fe2+ without antioxidant molecules. However, the antioxidant protection of monomeric ABeta¸40 depends on the type of oxidant used. ABeta¸40 inhibits cultured neurondeath caused by Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ but does not protect neurons against H2O2-induced damage [94]. In cerebral cortical neuronal cultures, monomeric ABeta¸40 inhibits the reduction of Fe3+ induced by vitamin C and the generation of superoxides and prevents lipid peroxidation induced by Fe2+ [94]. Moreover, monomeric forms of ABeta¸42 also exhibited antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. However, oligomeric or aggregated ABeta¸40 and ABeta¸42 were devoid of such antioxidant activity and their neuroprotective activity was demolished. Thus, depriving neurons of the protective activity of ABeta¸42 monomers may also be an important factor in neurodegeneration [97]. These findings provide novel insights on a normal antioxidant role of ABeta¸ and indicate that monomeric ABeta¸ protects neurons by quenching metal-inducible oxygen radical generation and thereby inhibits neurotoxicity."

SET Evidence = "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Activation of the neuronal pentameric nAChRs is involved in diverse brain functions including synaptic plasticity and memory [237, 238] and enhances transmitter release in several brain regions including the hippocampus [239], the spinal cord dorsal horn [240], the olfactory bulb, and the amygdala [241]. The increase of synaptic plasticity by ABeta¸ requires activation of nAChRs [242]. Because activation of nAChRs is necessary for the ABeta¸-induced increase of synaptic plasticity and memory under normal conditions, ABeta¸ may modify glutamate release with a mechanism dependent upon activation of nAChRs [83]. However, several reports of the effect of ABeta¸42 on nAChRs are conflicting. Some studies have reported that ABeta¸42 activates nAChRs [243, 244], while others indicate that ABeta¸42 inhibits nAChRs [245, 246]. Interestingly, picomolar concentrations of ABeta¸42 were effective in activating nAChRs while higher levels of ABeta¸ produced inhibitory action. The disparity may depend on the nanomolar ABeta¸1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ42 inhibition of nicotine-induced Ca2+ responses while picomolar ABeta¸42 directly evokes sustained increases in presynaptic Ca2+ via nAChRs [244]. ABeta¸42 binds to the nAChR with picomolar affinity [247]. This binding can modulate presynaptic, glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission or glutamate release, suggesting that ABeta¸42-dependent cholinergic modulation activates signal transduction mechanisms that ultimately result in synaptic transmission and memory consolidation [248]. However, it remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated by a direct physical interaction of the ABeta¸ peptide with the nAChRs. Immunohistochemical studies on human sporadic AD brains show that ABeta¸42 and nAChR, are both present in neuritic plaques and co-localize in individual cortical neurons suggesting that ABeta¸ could be tightly associated with nAChR [247]. Alternatively, ABeta¸ might be responsible for regulation of nAChR function through strong binding with membrane lipids [249]. Picomolar or higher ABeta¸42 acting through nAChRs, can elicit ERK MAPK activation in hippocampal cultures [245, 250] possibly triggered by Ca2+ influx [243, 251]. ERK is known to regulate transcription factors such as CREB and Elk-1 by phosphorylation [140], which help initiate transcription of memory-associated genes that contain their respective regulatory elements [252]. Therefore, over-activation of nAChRs and excessive Ca2+ influx or dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis provide a molecular mechanism for the cholinergic dysfunction that is a hallmark of AD [253, 254]."

After removal of anyof these components (Reelin, receptors, or Disabled-1), cortical layer formation is severely disrupted, leading to the model that these interactions are important for laminar organization in development.In synapses, Reelin promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits (e.g., NR2A) and facilitates LTP. Reelin signaling has an important role in NMDA and AMPA receptor function, maturation of glutamatergic synapses.ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin facilitates reorganization of actin filaments and affects neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. The Reelin-a3ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin interaction regulates neuronal migration, perhaps by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton, or by stabilizing the cytoskeleton through n-cofilin phosphorylation. Integrins also regulate synaptic glutamate receptor function, synaptic plasticity, working memory, and LTP. The APP-ÃƒÅ¸1 integrin interaction is also important in neurite outgrowth.

Consistent with Soba et al. (2005), the E1 domain plays a more active role in synaptic adhesion. Interestingly, the highly conserved GYENPTY sequence of the APP intracellular domain could form a tripartite complex with Munc 18 interacting protein (Mint/X11) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) similar to that of neurexin and SynCAM (Hata et al. 1996; Biederer and SÃƒÂ¼dhof 2000; Biederer et al. 2002), and the SynCAM carboxy-terminal sequence could functionally replace the corresponding APP domain in the coculture assay (Wang et al. 2009), suggesting that the Mint/CASK complexes may be the common mediators for the different classes of synaptic adhesion proteins.

SET Evidence = "During development of the nervous system a common set of signal transduction pathways appear to regulate growth cone behaviors, synaptogenesis and natural cell death, three fundamental processes that comprise the neurodevelopmental triad. Among the intercellular signals that coordinate the developmental triad in the mammalian brain are glutamate (the major excitatory neurotransmitter) and beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). Localization of ionotropic glutamate receptors to dendritic compartments allows for selective regulation of dendrite growth cones and spine formation by glutamate released from axonal growth cones and presynaptic terminals. Expression of particular subtypes of glutamate receptors peaks during a developmental time window within which synaptogenesis and natural neuronal death occur. Calcium is the preeminent second messenger mediating both acute (rapid remodelling of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletal systems) and delayed (transcriptional regulation of growth-related proteins; e.g., neurotrophins) actions of glutamate. The expression of beta APP in brain is developmentally regulated and it is expressed ubiquitously in differentiated neurons. beta APP is axonally transported and secreted forms of beta APP (sAPPs) are released from neurons in an activity-driven manner. Secreted APPs modulate neuronal excitability, counteract effects of glutamate on growth cone behaviors, and increase synaptic complexity. Acute actions of sAPPs appear to be transduced by cyclic GMP which promotes activation of K+ channels and reduces [Ca2+]i. Delayed actions of sAPPs may involve regulation of gene expression by the transcription factor NF kappa B. Finally, the striking effects of glutamate, neurotrophic factors, and sAPPs on synaptogenesis and neuronal survival in cell culture systems and in vivo suggest that each of these signals plays major roles in the process of natural cell death."

During development, Notch suppresses neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro (Geling et al., 2004; Kabos et al., 2002). When ligands bind Notch, proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors occurs by the gamma-secretase/nicastrin complex to release the signal-transducing Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (Yu et al., 2000). Cleaved NICDs translocate into the nucleus and interact with a nuclear protein named CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 (CSL) (Schroeter et al., 1998). The CSL and NICD complex activates expression of primary target genes of Notch, such as Hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) gene families (Jarriault et al., 1998). Following activation, Hes suppresses expression of transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, such as Mash1 and NeuroD (Pleasure et al., 2000). Notch activation is reported to strengthen glial differentiation by crosstalk to IL-6 signaling pathways, which is a known central regulator of gliogenesis. IL-6 cytokine signaling activation induces subsequent phosphorylation of gp130, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Kamakura et al., 2004). Upon Notch activation, increased Hes is known to facilitate complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, promoting STAT3 phosphorylation. This facilitates accessibility of STAT3 to the DNA binding element of the GFAP promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate APP may induce glial differentiation of NPCs through activation of the Notch signaling pathway."

Interestingly, Fe65 acts as a functional linker between APP and LRP (another type I membrane protein containing two NPXY endocytosis motifs) in modulating endocytic APP trafficking and ABeta¸ production. A conformational change introduced by phosphorylation at Thr668 (14 amino acids proximal to the YENPTY motif) interferes with Fe65 binding to APP and facilitates BACE1 and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Moreover, Fe65 stabilizes the highly labile AICD, which may serve as a regulatory step in modulating the physiological function of AICD (see below).

It is believed that this region acts in an integrin-like manner and can, accordingly, be blocked by RGDS peptide sequence derived from the fibronectin-binding domain. Similarly, APP colocalizes with integrins on the surface of axons and at sites of adhesion. Evidence of interaction with laminin and collagen provides further evidence of adhesion-promoting properties. Interestingly, because the RHDS sequence is contained within the N terminus of ABeta¸, similar cell adhesion-promoting properties have also been attributed to the ABeta¸ peptide itself. This latter property is, however, difficult to tease out in view of the cytotoxicity of ABeta¸ peptide when tested in a variety of cell systems in vitro. Furthermore, it is difficult to separate the cell adhesion-from the neurite outgrowth-promoting roles of APP. Clearly, these are probably somewhat inseparable, as neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and even synaptogenesis would involve substrate adhesion."

SET Evidence = "Iron was further demonstrated to modulate expression of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor holo-protein (APP) by a mechanism similar to that of regulation of ferritin-L and -H mRNA translation through an iron-responsive element (IRE) in their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Here, we discuss two aspects of the link between iron and AD, in relation to the recently discovered IRE in the 5'UTR of APP mRNA. The first is the physiological aspect: a compensatory neuroprotective response of amyloid-ÃƒÅ¸ protein (ABeta¸) in reducing iron-induced neurotoxicity. Thus, given that ABeta¸ possesses iron chelation sites, it is hypothesized that OS-induced intracellular iron may stimulate APP holo-protein translation (via the APP 5'UTR) and subsequently the generation of its cleavage product, ABeta¸, as a compensatory response that eventually reduces OS."

SET Evidence = "We found that APP was present in the postsynaptic density of central excitatory synapses and coimmunoprecipitated with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). The presence of APP in the postsynaptic density was supported by the observation that NMDARs regulated trafficking and processing of APP; overexpression of the NR1 subunit increased surface levels of APP, whereas activation of NMDARs decreased surface APP and promoted production of ABeta¸. We transfected APP or APP RNA interference into primary neurons and used electrophysiological techniques to explore the effects of APP on postsynaptic function. Reduction of APP decreased (and overexpression of APP increased) NMDAR whole cell current density and peak amplitude of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. The increase in NMDAR current by APP was due to specific recruitment of additional NR2B-containing receptors. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that APP increased the surface levels and decreased internalization of NR2B subunits. These results demonstrate a novel physiological role of postsynaptic APP in enhancing NMDAR function."

At the axon terminal, when BDNF binds to its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), the signal is propagated along the axon to the cell body, via retrograde transport, regulating gene expression and neuronal function. Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early impairments in synaptic function that may result in part from neurotrophin signaling deficits. Growing evidence suggests that soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) assemblies cause synaptic dysfunction by disrupting both neurotransmitter and neurotrophin signaling.

Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport.

SET Evidence = "Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates are the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient's brain. Abeta is known to bind p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and mediates Abeta-induced neuronal death. Recently, we showed that NGF leads to p75(NTR) polyubiquitination, which promotes neuronal cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that Abeta stimulation impaired the p75(NTR) polyubiquitination. TRAF6 and p62 are required for polyubiquitination of p75(NTR) on NGF stimulation. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of TRAF6/p62 restored p75(NTR) polyubiquitination upon Abeta/NGF treatment. Abeta significantly reduced NFkappaB activity by attenuating the interaction of p75(NTR) with IKKbeta. p75(NTR) increased NFkappaB activity by recruiting TRAF6/p62, which thereby mediated cell survival. These findings indicate that TRAF6/p62 abrogated the Abeta-mediated inhibition of p75(NTR) polyubiquitination and restored neuronal cell survival."

In addition, platelets contain important enzymes involved in inflammatory intermediary synthesis like phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and recent reports demonstrated significant changes in platelet levels and activities in Alzheimer's disease.

The presence of reactive astrocytes, astrogliosis, increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines are important pathological hallmarks of AD. We found that QUIN induces IL-1beta expression, a key mediator in AD pathogenesis, in human astrocytes. At pathophysiological concentrations QUIN induced a switch between structural protein expressions in a dose dependent manner, increasing VIM and concomitantly decreasing GFAP expression. Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity was used as a functional metabolic test for astrocytes. We found a significant dose-dependent reduction in GS activity following QUIN treatment. All together, this study showed that QUIN is an important factor for astroglial activation, dysregulation and cell death with potential relevance to AD and other neuroinflammatory diseases."

Moreover, it has been evidenced that an overproduction of NO in the central nervous system (CNS) may play a key role in aging and that the glial cells (microglials cells and probably astrocytes) are able to form consistent amounts of NO through the induction of a nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) isoform so-called inducible or inflammatory.We observed a decreased NO production after incubation with both LDL and HDL and an increased peroxynitrite production. As it concerns NOS expression, densitometric analysis of bands indicated that iNOS protein levels were significantly higher in the cells incubated with both AD lipoproteins and offspring lipoproteins compared to cells incubated with control lipoproteins.

In this study, we have determined the methylglyoxal and glyoxal levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients compared to healthy controls. Methylglyoxal levels in AD patients were twofold higher than in controls, but this difference was not significant due to the large intergroup variations and the small sample size. However, the concentrations of both compounds were five to seven times higher in CSF than in plasma. We also investigated the glyoxalase I level in AD and healthy control brains. The number of glyoxalase I- positive neurons were increased in AD brains compared to controls.

SET Evidence = "Epidemiological studies, indicating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the risk of developing AD, have encouraged the study on the role of inflammation in AD. The best-characterized action of most NSAIDs is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). The expression of the constitutively expressed COX-1 and the inflammatory induced COX-2 has been intensively investigated in AD brain and different disease models for AD. Despite these studies, clinical trials with NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors showed little or no effect on clinical progression of AD. The expression levels of COX-1 and COX-2 change in the different stages of AD pathology. In an early stage, when low-fibrillar Abeta deposits are present and only very few neurofibrillary tangles are observed in the cortical areas, COX-2 is increased in neurons. The increased neuronal COX-2 expression parallels and colocalizes with the expression of cell cycle proteins. COX-1 is primarily expressed in microglia, which are associated with fibrillar Abeta deposits. This suggests that in AD brain COX-1 and COX-2 are involved in inflammatory and regenerating pathways respectively. In this review we will discuss the role of COX-1 and COX-2 in the different stages of AD pathology."

Quantitative studies showed a significant decrease in CD200 protein and mRNA in AD hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, but not cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry of brain tissue sections of hippocampus, superior frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus and cerebellum from AD and non-demented cases demonstrated a predominant, though heterogeneous, neuronal localization for CD200. Decreased neuronal expression was apparent in brain regions affected by AD pathology. There was also a significant decrease in CD200R mRNA expression in AD hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, but not cerebellum. Low expression of CD200R by microglia was confirmed at the mRNA and protein level using cultured human microglia compared to blood-derived macrophages. Treatment of microglia and macrophages with interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 significantly increased expression of CD200R. Expression of these cytokines was not generally detectable in brain.

SET Evidence = "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) because APP is processed into the beta-peptide that accumulates in amyloid plaques, and APP gene mutations can cause early onset AD. Inflammation is also associated with AD as exemplified by increased expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in microglia in affected areas of the AD brain. Here we demonstrate that IL-1alpha and IL-1beta increase APP synthesis by up to 6-fold in primary human astrocytes and by 15-fold in human astrocytoma cells without changing the steady-state levels of APP mRNA. A 90-nucleotide sequence in the APP gene 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) conferred translational regulation by IL-1alpha and IL-1beta to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Steady-state levels of transfected APP(5'-UTR)/CAT mRNAs were unchanged, whereas both base-line and IL-1-dependent CAT protein synthesis were increased. This APP mRNA translational enhancer maps from +55 to +144 nucleotides from the 5'-cap site and is homologous to related translational control elements in the 5'-UTR of the light and and heavy ferritin genes. Enhanced translation of APP mRNA provides a mechanism by which IL-1 influences the pathogenesis of AD."

This neuroinflammatory reaction may account for at least part of the cognitive decline. In previous studies we observed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are associated with Abeta deposits in AD. In this study the molecular chaperones Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 were found to colocalize with CAA and capCAA in AD brains. In addition, Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 colocalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in capCAA-associated dyshoric angiopathy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Hsp20, HspB8 and HspB2B3 induced production of interleukin 8, soluble ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells and human brain astrocytes in vitro and that Hsp27 inhibited production of transforming growth factor beta 1 and CD40 ligand. Our results suggest a central role for sHsps in the neuroinflammatory reaction in AD and CAA and thus in contributing to cognitive decline."

However, when stratified according to CSF levels of tau and Abeta42, YKL-40 was elevated in those with an AD-indicative profile compared with stable MCI with a normal profile (p = 0.037). In addition, YKL-40 and sCD14 were very stable in AD patients with good correlation between time-points (r = 0.94, p = 3.4 Ãƒâ€” 10-25; r = 0.77, p = 2.0 Ãƒâ€” 10-11) and the cortical damage marker T-tau. Thus, microglial markers are stable and may be used as safety markers for monitoring CNS inflammation and microglia activation in clinical trials. Moreover, YKL-40 differentiates between AD and controls and between stable MCI to AD and those that convert to AD and VaD."

SET Evidence = "Glial activation and increased inflammation characterize neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim was to develop a model for studying phagocytosis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide by human microglia and to test effects thereupon by immunomodulatory substances. Human CHME3 microglia showed intracellular Abeta(1-42) colocalized with lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, indicating phagocytosis. This was increased by interferon-gamma, and to a lesser degree with Protollin, a proteosome-based adjuvant. Secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was decreased by Abeta(1-42) and by interferon-gamma and interleukin-1beta. These cytokines, but not Abeta(1-42), stimulated interleukin-6 release. Microglia which phagocytosed Abeta(1-42) exhibited a higher degree of expression of interleukin-1 receptor type I and inducible nitric oxide synthase. In conclusion, we show that human microglia are able to phagocytose Abeta(1-42) and that this is associated with expression of inflammatory markers. Abeta(1-42) and interferon-gamma decreased BDNF secretion suggesting a new neuropathological role for Abeta(1-42) and the inflammation accompanying AD."

SET Evidence = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an altered immune response, resulting in chronic increased inflammatory cytokine production with a prominent role of TNF-Î±. TNF-Î± signals are mediated by two receptors: TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Signaling through TNFR2 is associated with neuroprotection, whereas signaling through TNFR1 is generally proinflammatory and proapoptotic. Here, we have identified a TNF-Î±-induced proinflammatory agent, lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) via gene array in murine primary cortical neurons. Further investigation showed that Lcn2 protein production and secretion were activated solely upon TNFR1 stimulation when primary murine neurons, astrocytes, and microglia were treated with TNFR1 and TNFR2 agonistic antibodies. Lcn2 was found to be significantly decreased in CSF of human patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD and increased in brain regions associated with AD pathology in human postmortem brain tissue. Mechanistic studies in cultures of primary cortical neurons showed that Lcn2 sensitizes nerve cells to beta-amyloid toxicity. Moreover, Lcn2 silences a TNFR2-mediated protective neuronal signaling cascade in neurons, pivotal for TNF-Î±-mediated neuroprotection. The present study introduces Lcn2 as a molecular actor in neuroinflammation in early clinical stages of AD."

SET Evidence = "Rosiglitazone is a TZD derivative that was recently observed to improve cognition in both APP transgenic mice and AD patients [Watson et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 2006]. It activates PPARgamma leading to increased glucose disposal rates [Jung et al., 2005] and is also neuroprotective against Abeta neurotoxicity [Inestrosa et al., 2005]. Neuroprotection may result through modulation of Wnt signaling since an increase in beta-catenin and inhibition of GSK-3beta is observed upon exposure to rosiglitazone [Inestrosa et al., 2005], although a different study has shown that activation of PPARgamma by a potent ligand leads to beta-catenin degradation [Liu and Farmer 2004]. Nonetheless, in support of the role for PPARgamma activation in neuroprotection, PPARgamma agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects [Luna-Medina et al., 2005], inhibit microglial activation [Bernardo et al., 2005; Heneka et al., 2005] and have been shown to improve verbal memory in AD patients with T2DM, possibly in a mechanism dependent on PPARgamma activation . A recent report demonstrates that overexpression of PPARgamma in cultured cells leads to a dramatic decrease in the production of Abeta, by increasing the rate of APP degradation via ubiquitination [D'Abramo et al., 2005]. This study also showed that by decreasing Abeta secretion, PPARgamma protects the cells against H2O2-mediated necrosis [D'Abramo et al., 2005]."

SET Evidence = "As RNA stability is often regulated via 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), we analyzed the impact of the PPARgamma-3'-UTR by reporter assays using specific constructs. LPS significantly reduced luciferase activity of the pGL3-PPARgamma-3'-UTR, suggesting that PPARgamma1 mRNA is destabilized. Deletion or mutation of a potential microRNA-27a/b (miR-27a/b) binding site within the 3'-UTR restored luciferase activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-27b, which was induced upon LPS exposure, partially reversed PPARgamma1 mRNA decay, whereas miR-27b overexpression decreased PPARgamma1 mRNA content. In addition, LPS further reduced this decay. The functional relevance of miR-27b-dependent PPARgamma1 decrease was proven by inhibition or overexpression of miR-27b, which affected LPS-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-6. We provide evidence that LPS-induced miR-27b contributes to destabilization of PPARgamma1 mRNA. Understanding molecular mechanisms decreasing PPARgamma might help to better appreciate inflammatory diseases."

SET Evidence = "Microglia manage immunosurveillance and mediate inflammation, both suggested to be important in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate if microglial markers could differentiate, firstly between AD and controls, and secondly between stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those progressing to AD and vascular dementia (VaD). Furthermore, we investigated if these markers were sufficiently stable to be used in clinical trials. We quantified YKL-40 and sCD14 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 96 AD patients, 65 healthy controls, and 170 patients with MCI from baseline and over 5.7 years. For the stability analysis, two CSF samples were collected from 52 AD patients with a six-month interval in between. YKL-40, but not sCD14, was significantly elevated in AD compared with healthy controls (p = 0.003). Furthermore, YKL-40 and sCD14 were increased in MCI patients who converted to VaD (p = 0.029 and p = 0.008), but not to AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA. However, when stratified according to CSF levels of tau and ABeta42, YKL-40 was elevated in those with an AD-indicative profile compared with stable MCI with a normal profile (p = 0.037). In addition, YKL-40 and sCD14 were very stable in AD patients with good correlation between time-points (r = 0.94, p = 3.4 x 10-25; r = 0.77, p = 2.0 x 10-11) and the cortical damage marker T-tau. Thus, microglial markers are stable and may be used as safety markers for monitoring CNS inflammation and microglia activation in clinical trials. Moreover, YKL-40 differentiates between AD and controls and between stable MCI to AD and those that convert to AD and VaD."

AGI, MRC1 and YM1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the Tg-2576 mouse brains compared to age-matched controls while TNFalpha and NOS2 mRNA levels, genes commonly associated with classical activation, increased or did not change, respectively. Only TNFalpha mRNA increased in the Tg-SwDI mouse brain. Alternative activation genes were also identified in brain samples from individuals with AD and were compared to age-matched control individuals. In AD brain, mRNAs for TNFalpha, AGI, MRC1 and the chitinase-3 like 1 and 2 genes (CHI3L1; CHI3L2) were significantly increased while NOS2 and IL-1beta mRNAs were unchanged."

SET Evidence = "The secreted protein, YKL-40, has been proposed as a biomarker of a variety of human diseases characterized by ongoing inflammation, including chronic neurologic pathologies such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. However, inflammatory mediators and the molecular mechanism responsible for enhanced expression of YKL-40 remained elusive. Using several mouse models of inflammation, we now show that YKL-40 expression correlated with increased expression of both IL-1 and IL-6.
Furthermore, IL-1 together with IL-6 or the IL-6 family cytokine, oncostatin M, synergistically upregulated YKL-40 expression in both primary human and mouse astrocytes in vitro. The robust cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes required both STAT3 and NF-kB binding elements of the YKL-40 promoter.
In addition, YKL-40 expression was enhanced by constitutively active STAT3 and inhibited by dominant-negative IkBalpha. Surprisingly, cytokine-driven expression of YKL-40 in astrocytes was independent of the p65 subunit of NF-kB and instead required subunits RelB and p50. Mechanistically, we show that IL-1-induced RelB/p50 complex formation was further promoted by oncostatin M and that these complexes directly bound to the YKL-40 promoter. Moreover, we found that expression of RelB was strongly upregulated during inflammation in vivo and by IL-1 in astrocytes in vitro. We propose that IL-1 and the IL-6 family of cytokines regulate YKL-40 expression during sterile inflammation via both STAT3 and RelB/p50 complexes. These results suggest that IL-1 may regulate the expression of specific anti-inflammatory genes in nonlymphoid tissues via the canonical activation of the RelB/p50 complexes."

Importantly, CSF YKL-40/Abeta42 ratio predicted risk of developing cognitive impairment (CDR 0 to CDR > 0 conversion), as well as the best CSF biomarkers identified to date, tau/Abeta42 and p-tau 181/Abeta42. Mean plasma YKL-40 was higher in CDR 0.5 and 1 versus CDR 0, and correlated with CSF levels. YKL-40 immunoreactivity labeled astrocytes near a subset of amyloid plaques, implicating YKL-40 in the neuroinflammatory response to Abeta deposition. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that YKL-40, a putative indicator of neuroinflammation, is elevated in AD and, together with Abeta42, has potential prognostic utility as a biomarker for preclinical AD."

Recent studies have shown that synaptic loss in the cortex is the major correlate of cognitive decline in AD. In the present study we assessed synaptic proteins such as synaptobrevin, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), and syntaxin1/HPC-1 in control and AD brains to determine whether synaptic proteins are equally or differentially affected in AD. Western analysis showed that in AD levels of synaptobrevin and synaptophysin were decreased by some 30% from amounts in controls, while those of synaptotagmin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin 1/HPC-1 were decreased by only about 10%. As synaptobrevin and synaptophysin are localized mainly in transmitter-containing synaptic vesicles while SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1/HPC-1 are found in presynaptic plasma membranes, these results suggest differential involvement of synaptic components in AD."

The process of fusing synaptic plasma membranes and synaptic vesicles involves particular proteins, such as the soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins for docking both membranes, and is integral to neurotransmission. To elucidate whether oxidative stress induces denaturation of SNARE proteins, and whether vitamin E can counteract this process, changes in the expression of synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1 in rat brain nerve terminals were analyzed using an immunoblotting method. The results showed that oxidative stress induced significant reductions in the levels synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin in synaptic vesicles. Similarly, marked decreases in the levels of SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 in pre-synaptic plasma membranes were also observed. In the absence of oxidative stress, vitamin E-deficient rats exhibited similar decreases in these proteins."

Syntaxin 1 is a key soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein involved in synaptic vesicle docking/fusion events, and X11-alpha modulates amyloid precursor protein processing and beta amyloid generation. In this study, we demonstrate that Dyrk1A interacts with and phosphorylates Munc18-1 at the Thr(479) residue.

Here, we show that p73 drives the expression of microRNA (miR)-34a, but not miR-34b and -c, by acting on specific binding sites on the miR-34a promoter. Expression of miR-34a is modulated in parallel with that of TAp73 during in vitro differentiation of neuroblastoma cells and cortical neurons. Retinoid-driven neuroblastoma differentiation is inhibited by knockdown of either p73 or miR-34a. Transcript expression of miR-34a is significantly reduced in vivo both in the cortex and hippocampus of p73(-/-) mice; miR-34a and TAp73 expression also increase during postnatal development of the brain and cerebellum when synaptogenesis occurs. Accordingly, overexpression or silencing of miR-34a inversely modulates expression of synaptic targets, including synaptotagmin-1 and syntaxin-1A. Notably, the axis TAp73/miR-34a/synaptotagmin-1 is conserved in brains from Alzheimer's patients. These data reinforce a role for TAp73 in neuronal development."

However, with disease progression, microglia become dysfunctional, release neurotoxins, lose their ability to clear Abeta and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote Abeta production and accumulation. TREM2 has been shown to regulate the phagocytic ability of myeloid cells and their inflammatory response. Here we propose that the mechanism(s) by which TREM2 variants cause Alzheimer's disease are via down regulation of the Abeta phagocytic ability of microglia and by dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory response of these cells.

SET Evidence = "Abeta is widely accepted to be one of the major pathomechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD), although there is presently lively debate regarding the relative roles of particular species/forms of this peptide. Most recent evidence indicates that soluble oligomers rather than plaques are the major cause of synaptic dysfunction and ultimately neurodegeneration. Soluble oligomeric Abeta has been shown to interact with several proteins, for example glutamatergic receptors of the NMDA type and proteins responsible for maintaining glutamate homeostasis such as uptake and release. As NMDA receptors are critically involved in neuronal plasticity including learning and memory, we felt that it would be valuable to provide an up to date review of the evidence connecting Abeta to these receptors and related neuronal plasticity. Strong support for the clinical relevance of such interactions is provided by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. This substance is the only NMDA receptor antagonist used clinically in the treatment of AD and therefore offers an excellent tool to facilitate translational extrapolations from in vitro studies through in vivo animal experiments to its ultimate clinical utility"

Activation of inhibitory GABA(A) receptors by taurine blocked the increase in extracellular glutamate levels, suggesting that selective pharmacological inhibition of neuronal activity can counteract the impact of Amyloid beta on glutamate dyshomeostasis.

The activated (pY216) form of GSK-3beta, implicated in phosphorylating tau at S199, S212, T231, and PHF-1 sites, was most similar in that the stress-induced increment seen in wt mice was not evident in CRFR1−/− animals and was exaggerated in CRFR2−/− mice. Phosphorylation responses of both JNK isoforms were also significantly greater in CRFR2 knock-outs than in wt controls (p < 0.05). These kinases also exhibited pronounced elevations in basal phosphorylation in CRFR1-deficient mice, whose magnitude rivaled or exceeded stress-induced levels in wt mice. This may relate to the elevated tau-P levels seen under this condition at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites, although less-marked elevations of phosphorylated GSK-3beta and ERK2, and of p35 levels, in unstressed CRFR1−/− mice may also contribute in this regard.
