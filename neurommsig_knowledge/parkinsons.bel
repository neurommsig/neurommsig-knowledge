SET Evidence= "However, the N-terminally truncated Grb10 (BPS-SH2) shows no effect on receptor phosphorylation
or glucose uptake, implying that the N-terminal domains of Grb10 is essential to its regulatory effect on IR signaling [12].
Recent studies via yeast two-hybrid screening have demonstrated that the N-terminus of Grb10 interacts with
GYF proteins (GIGYF1 and GIGYF2), which are two novel and homologous proline motif binding proteins.
The GIGYF1 protein can be recruited to the activated insulin and IGF1 receptors through binding to the
N-terminus of Grb10. Subsequent studies using GIGYF2 null mice models showed that GIGYF2 gene disruption
in mice led to inhibition of IGF1-stimulated IGF1R tyrosine phosphorylation and consequently, the manifestation of
neurodegeneration [14]. Those findings suggest that Grb10 and GIGYF2 may act cooperatively to regulate IGF1R signaling.
In addition, a high level of GIGYF2 expression is presented in the pancreas and testis as well as brain
(including the hippocampus) of adult mouse, thus supporting a vital role of GIGYF2 in the regulation of
IGF1R signaling in the central NervousSystem (CNS) [15]. Most recently, several lines of evidence have
shown that GIGYF2 gene mutations are closely linked to human familial Parkinson's disease, one
of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, thus further supporting the notion that GIGYF2 may play a

SET Evidence = "The substitution of serine for glycine at position 2019 (G2019S) in the kinase
domain of LRRK2 represents the most prevalent genetic mutation in both familial and apparently
sporadic cases of PD. Because mutations in LRRK2 are likely associated with a toxic gain of function,
destabilization of LRRK2 may be a novel way to limit its detrimental effects. Here we show that LRRK2
forms a complex with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in vivo and that inhibition of Hsp90 disrupts the
association of Hsp90 with LRRK2 and leads to proteasomal degradation of LRRK2. Hsp90 inhibitors may therefore
limit the mutant LRRK2-elicited toxicity to neurons. As a proof of principle, we show that Hsp90 inhibitors
rescue the axon growth retardation caused by overexpression of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation in neurons. Therefore,
inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity can be achieved by blocking Hsp90-mediated chaperone activity and Hsp90
inhibitors may serve as potential anti-PD drugs."

PINK1 blocked mitochondrial release of apoptogenic cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell
death induced by proteasome inhibitor MG132. N-terminal truncated PINK1 (NDelta35), which lacks
mitochondrial localization sequence, did not block MG132-induced cytochrome c release and cytotoxicity.
Despite mitochondrial expression, PARK6 mutant (E240K), (H271Q), (G309D), (L347P), (E417G) and C-terminal

Overexpression of wild-type PINK1 blocked cytochrome c release and cell death caused by atractyloside,

SET Evidence = "PINK1 protects against oxidative stress by phosphorylating mitochondrial chaperone
TRAP1. Mutations in the PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause an autosomal recessive form
of Parkinson disease (PD). So far, no substrates of PINK1 have been reported, and the mechanism by
which PINK1 mutations lead to neurodegeneration is unknown. Here we report the identification of TNF
receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial molecular chaperone also known as heat shock
protein 75 (Hsp75), as a cellular substrate for PINK1 kinase. PINK1 binds and colocalizes with TRAP1
in the mitochondria and phosphorylates TRAP1 both in vitro and in vivo. We show that PINK1 protects
against oxidative-stress-induced cell death by suppressing cytochrome c release from mitochondria,
and this protective action of PINK1 depends on its kinase activity to phosphorylate TRAP1. Moreover,
we find that the ability of PINK1 to promote TRAP1 phosphorylation and cell survival is impaired by
PD-linked PINK1 G309D, L347P, and W437X mutations. Our findings suggest a novel pathway by which
PINK1 phosphorylates downstream effector TRAP1 to prevent oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis and
implicate the dysregulation of this Mitochondrial subgraph in PD pathogenesis."

Rab-like proteins and a kinase domain belonging to the tyrosine‚Äìkinase-like protein family (Fig. 1A). To probe the
potential reciprocity in activity between the two domains,we created a panel of functional mutations predicted to exert
specific defects in conserved residues crucial for enzyme activity (Fig. 1B). We established autophosphorylation
assays utilizing immunoprecipitated LRRK2 protein to assess kinase activity in combination with phosphorylation
of a generic kinase substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP).In comparison with autophosphorylation assays, MBP assays
generally demonstrate half the signal-to-noise ratio, although in all assays performed in this study, MBP substrate phos-
phorylation mimics the activity observed with autophosphorylation, but with more experimental variation (data not shown).
Consistent with published results (12,17), the K1906M mutation diminishes kinase activity presumably through
disruption of the highly conserved ATP-binding pocket.Similarly, the D1994A mutation inhibits kinase activity through mutation of the conserved aspartic acid

SET Evidence= "However, the N-terminally truncated Grb10 (BPS-SH2) shows no effect on receptor phosphorylation
or glucose uptake, implying that the N-terminal domains of Grb10 is essential to its regulatory effect on IR signaling [12].
Recent studies via yeast two-hybrid screening have demonstrated that the N-terminus of Grb10 interacts with
GYF proteins (GIGYF1 and GIGYF2), which are two novel and homologous proline motif binding proteins.
The GIGYF1 protein can be recruited to the activated insulin and IGF1 receptors through binding to the
N-terminus of Grb10. Subsequent studies using GIGYF2 null mice models showed that GIGYF2 gene disruption
in mice led to inhibition of IGF1-stimulated IGF1R tyrosine phosphorylation and consequently, the manifestation of
neurodegeneration [14]. Those findings suggest that Grb10 and GIGYF2 may act cooperatively to regulate IGF1R signaling.
In addition, a high level of GIGYF2 expression is presented in the pancreas and testis as well as brain
(including the hippocampus) of adult mouse, thus supporting a vital role of GIGYF2 in the regulation of
IGF1R signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) [15]. Most recently, several lines of evidence have
shown that GIGYF2 gene mutations are closely linked to human familial Parkinson's disease, one

During early brain development, most of brain synthesis is associated with myelin production. Cholesterol seems to be of particular
importance for the insulatory properties of myelin and there seems be a physiological imperative to maintain constant levels of
this steroid in the brain. To achieve this, a highly efficient bloodâˆšÂ¢â€šÃ‡Â¨â€šÃ„Ãºbrain barrier has been evolved that prevents exchange between

Notably, the expression of the gene coding for Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
protein (Arc) was found to be significantly suppressed (Mateos et al., 2009). This is of interest in view of the fact that Arc is
believed to be important for consolidation memory formation and is reduced in the brain of patients who have died of AD (Ginsberg

In addition Arc protein levels were reduced in hippocampal and cortical areas of the

of which were also reduced in the brain of the treated mice. Addition of low concentrations of 27-OHC to cultured hippocampal

SET Evidence = "The progressive memory loss observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by an increase in
the levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and a block of synaptic plasticity. Both synaptic plasticity and memory require
changes in the expression of synaptic proteins such as the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, Arc (also termed Arg3.1).
Using a model of synaptic plasticity in which BDNF increases Arc expression in cultured cortical neurons, we have
found that an oligomeric form of Abeta strongly inhibits the BDNF-induced increase of Arc expression. Given that Abeta
oligomers are likely to be involved in the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment observed in amyloid depositing
mouse models, we hypothesize that inhibition of Arc induction by BDNF contributes to the synaptic and memory deficits at
early stages of AD."

SET Evidence = "Recent evidence suggests that synaptic consolidation at excitatory medial perforant path-granule cell synapses
requires brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and induction of the immediate early gene activity-regulated
cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Arc mRNA is strongly induced and transported to dendritic processes following high-frequency
stimulation (HFS) that induces LTP in the rat dentate gyrus in vivo. Sustained synthesis of Arc during a surprisingly protracted
time-window is required for hyperphosphorylation of actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin and local expansion of the actin
cytoskeleton in vivo. Furthermore, this process of Arc-dependent synaptic consolidation is activated in response to brief
infusion of BDNF. Microarray expression profiling has revealed a panel of BDNF-regulated genes that may cooperate with Arc
during synaptic consolidation. In addition to regulating gene expression, BDNF signaling modulates the fine localization and
biochemical activation of the translation machinery. By modulating the spatial and temporal translation of newly induced (Arc)
and constitutively-expressed mRNA in dendrites, BDNF may effectively control the window of synaptic consolidation. Dysregulation
of BDNF synthesis and Arc function, specifically within the dentate gyrus, is linked to behavioral symptoms and cognitive
deficits in animal models of depression and Alzheimer's disease."

SET Evidence = "Na(v)1.7 sodium channels can amplify weak stimuli in neurons and act as threshold channels for firing action
potentials. Neurotrophic factors and pro-nociceptive cytokines that are released during development and under pathological conditions
activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Previous studies have shown that MAPKs can transduce developmental or pathological
signals by regulating transcription factors that initiate a gene expression response, a long-term effect, and directly modulate
neuronal ion channels including sodium channels, thus acutely regulating dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron excitability.
For example, neurotrophic growth factor activates (phosphorylates) ERK1/2 MAPK (pERK1/2) in DRG neurons, an effect that has been implicated in
injury-induced hyperalgesia. However, the acute effects of pERK1/2 on sodium channels are not known. We have shown previously that
activated p38 MAPK (pp38) directly phosphorylates Na(v)1.6 and Na(v)1.8 sodium channels and regulates their current densities
without altering their gating properties. We now report that acute inhibition of pERK1/2 regulates resting membrane potential
and firing properties of DRG neurons. We also show that pERK1 phosphorylates specific residues within L1 of Na(v)1.7, inhibition
of pERK1/2 causes a depolarizing shift of activation and fast inactivation of Na(v)1.7 without altering current density, and
mutation of these L1 phosphoacceptor sites abrogates the effect of pERK1/2 on this channel. Together, these data are consistent
with direct phosphorylation and modulation of Na(v)1.7 by pERK1/2, which unlike the modulation of Na(v)1.6 and Na(v)1.8 by pp38,
regulates gating properties of this channel but not its current density and contributes to the effects of MAPKs on DRG neuron
excitability."

(the F-box), Skp1 or the proteasome, indicating that Pof14 stability is controlled by an autocatalytic mechanism. Pof14 interacts
with the squalene synthase Erg9, a key enzyme in ergosterol metabolism, in a membrane-bound complex that does not contain the core SCF
components. pof14 transcription is induced by hydrogen peroxide and requires the Pap1 transcription factor and the Sty1 MAP kinase.
Pof14 binds to and decreases Erg9 activity in vitro and a pof14 deletion strain quickly loses viability in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide due to its inability to repress ergosterol synthesis. A pof14 mutant lacking the F-box and an skp1-3 ts mutant behave as
wild type in the presence of oxidant showing that Pof14 function is independent of SCF. This indicates that modulation of ergosterol

CGG repeat (>200) region upstream of the FMR1 gene that results in the lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).
Affected individuals display a neurobehavioral phenotype that includes a significant impairment in social cognition alongside deficits in
attentional control, inhibition and working memory. In contrast, relatively little is known about the trajectory and specificity of any
cognitive impairment associated with the fragile X premutation (carrier-status) (approximately 55-200 repeats). Here, we focus on one
aspect of cognition that has been well documented in the fragile X full mutation, namely social cognition. The results suggest that
premutation males display a pattern of deficit similar in profile, albeit milder in presentation, to that of the full mutation. However,
little evidence emerged for a correlation between CGG repeat length and severity of phenotypic outcomes. The findings are discussed in
the context of functional neuroimaging and brain-behaviour-molecular correlates. We speculate that the deficiencies in social cognition
are attributable to impairment of neural pathways modulated by the cerebellum."

AMPA glutamate receptor subtype 1 (GluR1) surface expression and phosphorylation in response to D1 receptor stimulation were reduced

hyperphosphorylation at serine sites and subcellular redistribution of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in both PFC and
striatum of Fmr1(-/-) mice. FMRP interacted with GRK2, and pharmacological inhibition of GRK2 rescued D1 receptor signaling in Fmr1(-/-) neurons.
Finally, D1 receptor agonist partially rescued hyperactivity and enhanced the motor function of Fmr1(-/-) mice. Our study has identified FMRP as
a key messenger for DA modulation in the forebrain and may provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying

have low early metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake, compared to 86% of noncarriers (P = .048). Similarly, the heart/mediastinum ratio in delayed metaiodobenzylguanidine images appeared to differ between these groups of

sepsis. Microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate innate immunocytes through pattern
recognition receptors. Similarly, cellular injury can release endogenous 'damage'-associated molecular

derived from bacteria and so might bear bacterial molecular motifs. Here we show that injury releases
mitochondrial DAMPs (MTDs) into the circulation with functionally important immune consequences. MTDs
include formyl peptides and mitochondrial DNA. These activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)
through formyl peptide receptor-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, respectively. MTDs promote PMN Ca(2+)
flux and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, thus leading to PMN migration and
degranulation in vitro and in vivo. Circulating MTDs can elicit neutrophil-mediated organ injury. Cellular
disruption by trauma releases mitochondrial DAMPs with evolutionarily conserved similarities to bacterial
PAMPs into the circulation. These signal through innate immune pathways identical to those activated in
sepsis to create a sepsis-like state. The release of such mitochondrial 'enemies within' by cellular injury
is a key link between trauma, inflammation and SIRS."

are a common cause of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). Previous work has led to the
identification of a number of Parkin substrates that implicate specific pathways in ARJP pathogenesis,
including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell cycle activation. To test the involvement of previously
implicated pathways, as well as to identify novel pathways in ARJP pathogenesis, we are using genetic and
genomic approaches to study Parkin function in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In previous work,
we demonstrated that Drosophila parkin null mutants exhibit mitochondrial pathology and flight muscle
degeneration. To further explore the mechanisms responsible for pathology in parkin mutants, we
analyzed the transcriptional alterations that occur during muscle degeneration and performed a
genetic screen for parkin modifiers. Results of these studies indicate that oxidative stress response
components are induced in parkin mutants and that loss-of-function mutations in oxidative stress
components enhance the parkin mutant phenotypes. Genes involved in the innate immune response are also
induced in parkin mutants. In contrast, our studies did not reveal evidence for cell cycle or ER stress

well-established role in mitophagy, and mutations in the parkin gene (PARK2) lead to increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease.
Surprisingly, genetic polymorphisms in the PARK2 regulatory region are also associated with increased susceptibility to intracellular
bacterial pathogens in humans, including Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, but the function of parkin in immunity
has remained unexplored. Here we show that parkin has a role in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy of M. tuberculosis. Both parkin-deficient mice

production of IL-1beta. The adaptor ASC is necessary for NLRP3-dependent inflammasome function, but it is not known whether ASC is a sufficient
partner and whether inflammasome formation occurs in the cytosol or in association with mitochondria is controversial. Here, we show that
the mitochondria-associated adaptor molecule, MAVS, is required for optimal NLRP3 inflammasome activity. MAVS mediates recruitment of NLRP3
to mitochondria, promoting production of IL-1beta and the pathophysiologic activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo. Our data support a more
complex model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation than previously appreciated, with at least two adapters required for maximal function.
Because MAVS is a mitochondria-associated molecule previously considered to be uniquely involved in type 1 interferon production, these
